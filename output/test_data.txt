Question: 
I am going through a divorce. He is extremely angry. He refuses to physically assist me with our teenager daughter. I have no extended family support. Often times, I feel overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. I feel out of control, sad and depressed on a daily basis. I am just going through the motions of life every day. I am in my mid-50s. I have almost 29 years on my job. How can I handle this?
REAL ANSWER: 
Going through a divorce is often a very low point for the people involved.Are you surprised that your soon to be ex doesn't help with your teenage daughter?Usually patterns and dynamics in parenting are not sudden developments.Is it possible that what you're feeling now is more intensity to the stress of parenting by yourself, not that this is a sudden problem?This is relevant because you may be more familiar and more capable than you're giving yourself credit. The lack of emotional support is definitely stressful.Your parenting skills may still be at the level at which they were prior to the divorce.Take your emotional weariness seriously and reflect on the various ways of stress relief which are available and interest you.Give yourself extra time to rest, nurture yourself and be flexible in finding what feels right for stabilizing yourself.Since you talk about your daughter and help in physical ways, if it is a matter of strength that you need, talk with your attorney so that the child custody agreement includes whatever is physically necessary in the way of strength, in taking care of your daughter.The Courts are very good at making effort that the custody agreement offers proper care to the kids.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time with your divorce and the lack of support. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. It's important to remember that you're not alone and there are steps you can take to handle this difficult situation.

Firstly, it might be helpful to seek support from a therapist or counselor. Speaking with a professional can provide you with a safe space to express your emotions and help you navigate through the challenges you're facing. They can also provide you with coping strategies and help you develop a plan to prioritize your well-being.

Additionally, finding a support network of friends or other individuals going through a divorce can be beneficial. Connecting with others who can relate to your experiences can provide you with a sense of validation, understanding, and empathy. Online support groups or local divorce support groups might be worth exploring.

In terms of managing the overwhelming emotions and feeling out of control, it can be helpful to establish daily routines and self-care practices. Taking small steps, such as engaging in activities you enjoy, incorporating exercise into your routine, practicing mindfulness or deep breathing exercises, and ensuring you get enough rest, can all contribute to your overall well-being.

Regarding your job, it might be worth discussing your situation with your employer if you feel comfortable. You can inquire about any support or accommodations they may be able to provide during this challenging time. This could include flexible working hours or adjustments to your workload to help with the

Question: 
I'm not suicidal and wouldn't take my own life, but sometimes, I've wished for an accident to occur and take it. I feel like I just shouldn't be here and wish I wouldn't have been born so I didn't have to go through life. For me, it's a chore, but I don't know if that's normal or a sign of something.
REAL ANSWER: 
Sounds like a sign of great unhappiness, or sadness, or insecurity.The real way you'll find out what this feeling is about is to ask yourself your own question. Inside you are the only one who will feel when you discover the true answer to your question.Everyone feels some amount of discontent in their lives once in a while. Its normal to not feel entirely happy all the time.Try to accept your unhappiness as motivation to learn more about who you are, what you like, whom you like.Study yourself bc this way you increase the chance to find a road which feels right and happy.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Feeling suicidal is never "normal." That doesn't mean, however, that you are "crazy" or "broken." A lot of people feel the way you do. When life is no fun and you can't imagine it will ever be, the idea of no longer existing can be tempting. What I'm wondering is why you wouldn't think of it as "suicide" if the death was accidental. A lot of us worry that the people around us would be better off if we were dead. I'm wondering if that's something that plays into your wish for an accident. Because the thing is that even with an accident, an unplanned death hurts people. And even though we don't know for sure what happens when we die, most people really hope that what comes after won't hurt them or others any more than they already hurt. People do care about you, even if sometimes you can't see it. If you're feeling very stuck, it might help to talk to a counselor. You can find someone in your area at .

Question: 
There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home. I have food, clothes, and a university education, but I never feel like I belong. Even when I have a good time with people who are supposed to be close, I feel like I'm just out with friends and I never go home.
REAL ANSWER: 
From the little bit you wrote, my guess is you haven't figured out where and how to lay down your own set of roots.Usually people who have a university level eduction are old enough to work in order to support themselves.Unless you have a medical condition which limits or prevents you from working a full-time job, would you guess that the effort and thought involved in deciding in what professional area and geographic location to look for work, would offer you a way to establish your identity?My suggestion is to pay more attention to your own likes, dislikes, and interests. To know these areas more deeply would define the type of people with whom you identify, have a common interest and with whom you'd like to socialize.The more you realize who you are, the easier time you'll have to find like-minded others and feel securely at home with them and yourself.Again, if you have a medical disability or condition which prevents employment or easily socializing with other people, then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It's understandable that despite having a loving support system and all the basic necessities, you still feel a sense of not belonging. Feeling disconnected despite being surrounded by people can be quite distressing. It's important to remember that it's okay to experience these emotions, and you're not alone in feeling this way.

One possible reason for feeling this sense of detachment could be a lack of deeper emotional connection with those around you. While it's great to have friends and a support system, it's also important to develop intimate connections with individuals who truly understand and relate to you on a deeper level. Building these connections often takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself.

Additionally, it might be helpful to explore your own perspective and expectations regarding what belonging means to you. Sometimes, our own internal beliefs or past experiences can shape our sense of belonging. Reflecting on these experiences and examining any underlying issues can often offer valuable insights.

Engaging in activities or practices that promote self-awareness and self-acceptance might also help you develop a stronger sense of belonging. Exploring activities that bring you joy, pursuing hobbies, or joining interest-based communities can enable you to meet like-minded individuals who share similar interests and values.

Remember, nurturing a sense of belonging is a personal and ongoing journey. It's important to be gentle with yourself and seek support from others if needed. If these feelings persist and cause significant distress, consider seeking professional help from a counselor who can guide you through this process.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
What a profound and very troubling matter! Unless you are really feeling as if you had been totally alienated from the family you grew up with, I would have to think that these feelings of not belonging originate internally and come from another time in your life. That said, I just haven't enough information, do I? The answer lies in working more deeply with a therapist and being willing to journey inward in order to discover the true origin of the problem. I cannot stress enough the amazing healing that can take place in this kind of self-exploratory therapy. Find a good therapist who you feel trustworthy with and you'll discover the key. Best Wishes!

Question: 
I am a teenager. I have been experiencing major episodes of depression (if that's even what it is) for several years. It’s always getting worse. I have been having panic attacks, feeling like I can't control my fears, and I can't even bring myself to care if I live or die anymore. The problem is that I don't know who to ask for help. When I try to talk to my parents, I freeze completely and can't do anything but make a joke because never once in my life have we talked about our feelings.
REAL ANSWER: 
I understand that talking about our feelings can be awkward and using jokes is a way to relieve that awkwardness, but there is a right or wrong way to talk about your feelings. The important part is to recognize that you need help addressing those feelings and reaching out, which you are doing already. Having small conversations with your family is helpful, you can explain to them that you have been experiencing emotional discomfort and would like to talk to them about it. Since you been experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and have thought about dying, It is VERY important that you ask them to help you make an appointment with a mental health professional. Those symptoms indicate that your body is having a hard time managing intense feelings and it will be helpful if you understand why they occur and how to cope with them.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time, but I'm glad you reached out for support. It takes a lot of courage to open up about how you're feeling, especially when you haven't had much experience discussing emotions with your parents. It's important to remember that you're not alone, and there are people who can offer help and support.

One option you might consider is speaking with a trusted adult in your life, such as a teacher, school counselor, or another family member. These individuals can provide guidance and help you in finding the professional help you need. Sometimes it's easier to start a conversation about your feelings with someone who is not as close to you personally.

Additionally, many schools and communities have mental health resources available. You can reach out to your school counselor or nurse and ask about the resources they offer. They may be able to provide counseling or refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in working with teenagers.

If you ever feel like you're in immediate danger or are having thoughts of self-harm, it's crucial to reach out for help right away. In the United States, you can contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. They provide free and confidential support 24/7.

Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength, and there are people who care about your well-being. Keep reaching out until you find the support you need. You deserve help and support in

Try doing something physical. If you haven't exercised before, it is a good idea to get your doctor's approval first, but this can be helpful.The more you can find out about when you want to cut, the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do. If you are feeling sad or angry or nervous, look at what is leading up to those feelings and talk to someone about that.You said you are alone. I would see if you can find someone that you can trust to talk with about what you are going through. This could be a parent, a friend, someone at school, a coworker, or any number of other people.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Being lonely is an emotion and one that many different factors contribute to. Is there a certain reason the you are alone? It may help to re-evaluate how to make the changes necessary in order to not be alone. Our emotion can also be a powerful motivator of behaviour. By telling yourself that you cannot handle it, or "x" has "abandoned" you may be triggering the desire to self harm. These are all very valid things to talk with yourself about as they may lead to some potential solutions.What I can definitely say is that someone is always willing to listen. One suggestion is to join a Meetup group in your area of something that you are interested in. They exist so that people can make new friends.If you do not wish to self harm then try to remind yourself of the reasons that you would not want to do this. What are the draws of doing this behaviour? Is it because you want someone to help you? As stated before there are people out there that may be willing. Is it because you want to punish yourself? Sometimes these beliefs are very deep rooted. In addition to my previous advice, visit some of the different resources online for self harm and share your concerns with your GP. If you are local to Peterborough, ON then DeNovo has a self help program. There is always hope and there is always help. Just reach out and keep reaching out <3

Question: 
I've been feeling worthless, unaccomplished, and so frustrated. I want to break things, hit myself, run away, kick, scream, and cry. I just want to be happy and outgoing again. I want to be able to take care of my daughter and live comfortably.
REAL ANSWER: 
Philadelphia, there is help out there. For your daughter's sake, start somewhere. Feelings are only that; your worst fears about who you are are only based on a few moments that haven't gone well. Depression is so treatable, but you have to seek treatment from a professional.Here's a quick exercise for you to do that can show you how therapy might work... fear is telling you the worst possible story of your life, right? So... if there was an opposite story...the very best story that someone could tell about you and your life...what would that be? Who would be telling it? Someone who loves you? Someone who was around you when you were that outgoing person? Someone who's been watching your life from the start? God? Write that best story. I dare you to give it as much credibility as the worst one. Therapy is often about helping people reject their "worst stories". I invite you to start exploring with a qualified therapist whatever barriers stand between you and your best life. I hope you reach out soon. :)

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of negative emotions and are struggling to find happiness and fulfillment. Remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and seeking support is an important step towards finding solutions.

It can be helpful to start by understanding the root causes of your feelings. Is there something specific that's been contributing to your sense of worthlessness and frustration? Sometimes, talking to someone you trust, like a friend, family member, or counselor, can provide an opportunity for self-reflection and support.

Taking care of your mental health is crucial, especially when you have responsibilities like taking care of your daughter. Consider setting aside some time for self-care activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Engaging in activities you enjoy, exercising regularly, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and establishing a support system are all helpful ways to manage stress and promote well-being.

It's also important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and it's not fair to compare your achievements to those of others. Focus on your own progress and personal growth, and try to set realistic goals that can help you regain a sense of accomplishment. Breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming.

If you find your negative emotions persisting and interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional. They can provide valuable guidance and support tailored to your specific situation.

No matter how your relationship with your mother was, it makes sense that your mother's death, pregnancy, or becoming a mother is bringing up a lot of emotions. There is no one way we are "supposed" to feel after someone we care about passes away or becoming a m o t h e r, but there are healthy ways to try to cope with your feelings. I can already tell that, even though you may not realize it, you love your daughter very much and you don't want these feeling to get in the way of being a good mom to her. A good mom with a good family doesn't mean that you never feel anger or sadness. It means, most importantly, that you have time and you are committed to these good things. I would recommend finding a therapist who feels like a good fit for you so you can start working on yourself (which is the work that we all need to do!). Hope that helps.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time right now. It's understandable that feeling unemployed, rejected, and overwhelmed can lead to feelings of depression and hopelessness. It's important to remember that everyone faces challenges in life, and sometimes it feels like we're trapped in a never-ending cycle. However, I want you to know that it's possible to find a way out of this difficult situation.

First of all, it's important to take care of your mental health. Depression can make it even more challenging to deal with the problems you're facing, so finding support and coping strategies is crucial. Have you considered seeking therapy or counseling? Speaking with a professional can help you navigate your emotions and provide you with guidance on how to move forward.

In terms of your unemployment and housing situation, it might be helpful to break things down into smaller, more manageable steps. Focus on one task at a time, such as updating your resume or searching for job opportunities in your area. Remember, setbacks happen, but it's important to persist and stay resilient.

Regarding the past mistakes that are affecting your current circumstances, it's important to acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes. It's part of being human. While it can be difficult, try not to dwell on the past and instead focus on what you can do now to improve your situation. Sometimes, seeking legal advice or assistance can help provide options for addressing past mistakes.

Additionally, communication is key when it comes to your relationship. Talk

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Tough time you are going through right now; feeling overwhelmed, can't seem to find the right job; can't let go of the past mistakes that seem to be haunting you. I am guessing if the past is still affecting you, the issues related haven't been reconciled yet. The opportunity to address those issues would be a great thing for you; to let go of them. So spend some time if you need to see a therapist to come to grips with the past, so you can then focus on the future. Be clear in your thinking of what it is you are good at, where you need to beef up your skills and what you like to do. If you want to work in a field that requires a certain level of education, consider going to school the job you don't want to do that you don't like. You say you're unemployed; if there is a job you can find that just brings in some income for the time-being, what happens then there's one less thing to worry about but you might cringe at the job that used to do which brings me to the idea of being open-minded. It's tough because life doesn't seem to be working out very well but consider a different perspective, so you can use this as a 'reset-button' which sometimes helps.Depression can affect the way that you think; the way that you think can contribute to or increase depression so if you aren't in therapy and you aren't on medication, see someone.

Question: 
I always feel like I'm not good enough and it literally is so hard living. I don't know how to talk to my parents about it.
REAL ANSWER: 
Are you a teen? This is a really hard problem for more teens (and adults) than let on. When I was about 15, I remember asking my parent's friend, , whether life gets any easier when you get older. He said the problems are actually harder, but you gain the ability to deal with them better. I've been an adult a long time now, and that is so true. If you need someone to talk to, consider a teacher or a school guidance counselor or someone you respect, maybe in church. If they're good and they don't know how to help you, they may know how to get you to someone who can. Also, the idea of not being "good enough" is a common psychological event. In CBT it's called a "core belief," but I call it a "core lie" in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human. If you are serious about changing yourself, read about it at www.LivingYes.org and pick up a copy there or on Amazon. I hope this was helpful.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but please remember that you're not alone. Many people struggle with feelings of not being good enough. It can be difficult to talk to parents about such personal and sensitive issues, but having a support system in place can make a big difference. Here are a few suggestions for approaching this conversation:

1. Choose a comfortable and appropriate time: Find a calm moment when your parents are available and not preoccupied, so they can give you their undivided attention.

2. Express your feelings honestly: Explain to your parents how you've been feeling and the thoughts you've been having. Be open and honest about the impact it is having on your well-being.

3. Communicate your needs: Share what kind of support you're seeking from them. It could be emotional support, understanding, guidance, or even professional help. Clarify how they can effectively support you during this time.

4. Be prepared for their response: Understand that your parents might not fully comprehend or respond in the way you expect initially. Give them some time to process the information and be patient with their reactions.

5. Seek external support if needed: If for any reason, you feel uncomfortable discussing this with your parents or need additional support, consider reaching out to a counselor at school, a trusted teacher, or a helpline designed for providing support to people in emotional distress.

Remember, you deserve help and support. It takes courage to reach out, and I'm

Question: 
I have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. I really want to stop it and enjoy things.
REAL ANSWER: 
Thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency. Human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people, places, and things to let us know more about ourselves. We also have an inner voice, dialogue, conscience, etc. that helps us to determine the path for us. Often, when someone is worried about the external feedback, and focuses on this as the sole source of information, it can create a dependency that can become problematic. Balance is key to so many things in life. Your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek. Don't discount it and rely only on the voices of others.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I understand how challenging it can be to constantly worry about what others may think of you. It's important to remember that you deserve to enjoy things and live your life free from the burden of constantly seeking validation from others.

Here are a few strategies that may help:

1. Challenge your negative thoughts: Whenever you catch yourself worrying about what others might think, challenge those thoughts. Remind yourself that it is impossible to control or please everyone, and that their opinions do not define your worth or happiness.

2. Focus on self-acceptance: Learn to accept and embrace who you are, including your imperfections. Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes or have different opinions. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would extend to a friend.

3. Shift your perspective: Try to shift your focus from seeking external validation to internal validation. Instead of relying on others to determine your worth, learn to cultivate self-confidence and rely on your own judgment. Emphasize your strengths and accomplishments, and celebrate them.

4. Surround yourself with supportive people: Surrounding yourself with people who accept and appreciate you for who you are can be incredibly empowering.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
You are expressing one of the major issues of being human: recognition and acceptance from others. All of us crave and seek it in ways both conscious and unconscious. In fact, you could say that it is in order to keep us all "in check". If you hurt or destroy others then the rest of us will probably kick you out of the group.Then, there is some of us that focus so much on this that it tends to run our lives. Is this you? Do you define "enjoying things" as others saying "I like how Jane is having fun". Normal? Yes. Enjoyable? Not from the sound of it. Bad habit? If it gets in the way of you doing other things, then, Yes. If you are stuck and need some help, find yourself a logical-minded psychotherapist and work your way out of it. It is VERY hard to measure yourself by how YOU think of you and NOT care about what others think. It is also VERY rewarding!

Question: 
Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.
REAL ANSWER: 
Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reaction which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, the autonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response). This system is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe. It is largely an unconscious function, but with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare and cope for larger presentations. One of the greatest applications of addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when it does happen (not if but when) that they are able to move through the challenge with success. You can learn more about his by going to TED Talks “What I learned about going blind in space” It is a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with it.  With that being said, finding a program like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help. Working with a counselor who can help you utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as well. Good luck!

Raw GPT Answer: 
It sounds like you may be experiencing social anxiety, which is a very common reaction to public speaking or being in large crowds. I understand how distressing and overwhelming it can feel. Remember, you're not alone in this and there are ways to manage and overcome these feelings.

One technique you can try is deep breathing exercises. When you start feeling anxious, take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help regulate your breathing and calm your nervous system.

Another helpful strategy is gradually exposing yourself to situations that make you anxious. Start by practicing speaking in front of smaller groups or trusted friends and gradually work your way up. Taking small steps can help build your confidence and reduce anxiety over time.

It may also be beneficial to challenge any negative thoughts or beliefs you have about public speaking or being in crowds. Recognize that everyone experiences nerves to some extent, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Remind yourself of your strengths and positive qualities, and focus on the message or purpose behind your speaking engagement.

If these suggestions don't alleviate your symptoms or if your anxiety becomes significantly debilitating, it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide additional resources and guidance tailored to your specific needs.

Remember, it's important to be kind and patient with yourself during this process. Overcoming anxiety takes time and practice. You're capable of managing this, and I believe in your ability to grow stronger and more confident in these situations.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Public speaking is very difficult for many people. There are some things you can do on your own to address the symptoms you describe. Try this technique each day for a week (or more often if desired) which uses a grounding technique and also addresses your fears: set a timer or an alarm to repeat every 3-4 hours and when it goes off, ask yourself, "What am I feeling right now with regard to the potential for public speaking?" Once you have named your fear or fears, state that you are releasing that fear and that you can handle your life (which includes speaking in public).Follow that up with deep breathing. Inhale fully through your nose and then exhale completely through your mouth, gradually slowing your breath to about three deep breaths per minute, which should take about 20 seconds. When you feel balanced, ask yourself what kind of statements you need to hear with regard to what you named and journaled earlier. You want these statements to give you confidence. Here are some examples if fear public speaking: "I can handle it if I speak in public"; "I have a lot to say, even if I feel nervous"; as well as any other confidence-building statements with which you identify. When you have your statements, repeat them to yourself in your mind and then gradually open your eyes and stay where you are for a few seconds before rising to resume your schedule.

Question: 
I met a guy a while ago, and I can't stop thinking about him. I feel like I love him, but I don't think I know him. What if he is not who I think he is? I cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend. I don't know, am I too obsessive? Every time we talk though, it's like magic. He makes me feel amazing, but what if I'm mistaken?
REAL ANSWER: 
, it sounds like you're living this relationship in your mind, instead of in the real world. You can get answers to your questions by talking to him...getting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have. You're asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship. So what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him? Fear of rejection? Fear of something else? If you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships, I recommend a therapist to help you work through that. I wish you well. :)

Raw GPT Answer: 
It's completely normal to have strong feelings for someone you've just met, especially if they make you feel amazing when you're with them. However, it's important to remember that these feelings might be based on infatuation or idealization rather than a deep understanding of who this person truly is.

It's natural to have doubts and concerns about whether someone is who you think they are. It can be challenging to differentiate between what we want to see in someone and who they truly are. Take some time to get to know him better and observe how he treats others, as it can be a good indicator of his character.

While it's okay to feel excited about someone, it's important to avoid fixating too much on a potential relationship or creating unrealistic expectations. Allow the relationship to naturally unfold and take the time to understand the person holistically.

Remember, it's also essential to take care of yourself emotionally. Allow yourself to experience and process your emotions, but try not to let them consume you. Engage in activities that bring you joy, spend time with friends and family, and focus on personal growth. This will help you maintain a healthy balance in your life.

If you continue to feel overwhelmed by your emotions or find it difficult to let go of obsessive thoughts, it might be beneficial to seek support from a professional counselor who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.

I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I’m having bad flashbacks. I’m scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.
REAL ANSWER: 
I'm sorry for your suffering.There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening.Once you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program, you'll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular life.Then, you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friend.Sending good wishes in your work!

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm so sorry to hear about what you've experienced. It's completely understandable that you're feeling terrified, having flashbacks, and struggling to sleep or leave your house. It takes a lot of strength to reach out and share such a traumatic experience, so please know that I'm here to support you.

It's important to remind yourself that what happened was not your fault. Rape is an act of violence and power that can happen to anyone, regardless of gender or the relationship with the perpetrator. I encourage you to consider seeking professional help, such as a counselor or therapist, who can provide specialized support during this difficult time. They can help you process the trauma, identify coping strategies, and assist you in finding ways to heal and regain control over your life.

In the meantime, there are some self-care activities you can practice to help manage your symptoms. Deep breathing exercises, grounding techniques (such as focusing on your senses or using a stress ball), and engaging in calming activities like reading or painting could potentially help you during times of distress. Creating a safe space within your home, free from reminders of the trauma, might also be helpful.

Remember, healing takes time, and everyone's journey is different. Share your feelings with trusted friends or family members who can offer support. You are not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to help you through this difficult period. Take it one day at a time and be kind to yourself – you deserve compassion and healing.

Question: 
I have four children. One of them is in her 20s, and she cannot afford to go, nor can I pay for her. She went last year for two weeks by herself.
REAL ANSWER: 
I imagine you are trying to figure out a way to be "fair" to your adult kids. The key word is "adult". If your daughter can afford to join the family for a vacation that's great, she's welcome to come. However, as you pointed out she took a vacation by herself last year - she chose to put her resources (time off work and money) into doing that. Good for her - she did what she wanted. If she wants to budget time and money for a family vacation she will.As for feeling guilty, let me echo the sentiments already offered - vacations are lovely, but not a survival need. Your girl is in her 20s and it's her turn to provide for herself. You did your parenting - now go enjoy your vacation with whoever can, and wants to, join you!

Raw GPT Answer: 
It sounds like you're concerned about the financial situation of your child in her 20s and her inability to afford to go on a trip. I can understand that it's tough to see your child struggling, especially when you are unable to support them financially.

First, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your child about their current financial situation and any possible options they might have. It's important to listen to their perspective and understand the reasons behind their financial constraints. This way, you can gain a better understanding of what kind of support they might need from you, whether it's emotional or practical.

Remember, not everything is about money, and there can be alternative ways to support your child. Encourage her to explore other options like looking for scholarships, grants, or other financial assistance available for young adults who want to travel. Additionally, helping her develop budgeting skills and finding ways to save money can be valuable in the long run.

Lastly, remind your child that going on a trip is not the only way to explore and have new experiences. Encourage her to seek out opportunities closer to home that may be more affordable or even consider looking for part-time work to save for future trips.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to be understanding, supportive, and encourage your child to explore different possibilities.

Question: 
I have three children: a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. I'm scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.
REAL ANSWER: 
Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms. It is not just for addiction, and often we blame the ones closest to us. You can not stop them from blaming you, you can stop yourself for taking on the burden. We are all in charge of the choices we make. No one makes us do something other than our self. We choose how we internalize and react to situations. I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. It sounds like you're going through a lot of pain and guilt right now, and that can be incredibly difficult to handle. It's important to remember that you are not solely responsible for the choices your children make. Addiction is a complex issue, and there are many factors that contribute to it.

It's understandable that your daughter is angry and upset right now, but their blaming you is not fair or helpful. It may be helpful to have a conversation with her when emotions have settled, and express that you understand her pain, but also acknowledge that addiction is a personal struggle, and each individual must take responsibility for their own choices.

Given your own health challenges, it's also essential that you prioritize your own well-being. Taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's necessary in order to be there for your children. Consider reaching out to a support group or a counselor who can provide guidance and advice on how to navigate this difficult situation.

Lastly, remember that addiction is a disease, and recovery is a long and complex journey. Encourage your children to seek professional help and support them in finding resources that can aid their recovery. It's crucial to keep an open line of communication, love them unconditionally, and offer help when they are ready to accept it.

Please remember that you're not alone in this, and reaching out for help is always a courageous step.

Me and my adult daughter just do not get along. She's very belittling to me when I don't agree with her. It's almost like she scolds me. We get into all out war. She's said I don't support her in what she does and that I've never loved her. She calls me horrible names, and she pushes my buttons to the point I call her names.
REAL ANSWER: 
As frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughter's comments sound, there's also a message in them about how she genuinely feels.To some degree, your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the other.Developing ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel, would probably help a lot.One major point to be aware, is that the mother/daughter relationship dynamic, because it is strong, may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adults.Watch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority, instead of considering her as a grown person.The same is true of your daughter. She may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she is.Her needs from you are real, they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way.

I'm sorry to hear that you're facing such a difficult situation with your daughter. It can be incredibly hurtful to experience belittling and name-calling from someone you love. It sounds like there is a lot of tension and miscommunication between the two of you. It's important to remember that communication breakdowns are often a result of unresolved underlying issues. 

One possible approach you could consider is finding a calm moment to have an open and honest conversation with your daughter. Let her know that you value your relationship with her and that you're willing to work towards a healthier dynamic. Encourage her to express her feelings and concerns without interrupting or becoming defensive. It's crucial to actively listen to her, acknowledging her emotions and validating her point of view. 

In turn, communicate your own feelings calmly and without becoming accusatory. Express your desire to support her, but also share your need for respect and understanding in return. Avoid name-calling and try to keep the conversation focused on resolving conflicts rather than escalating them.

Additionally, it might be helpful to consider seeking professional help, such as family therapy. A therapist can facilitate a safe space for both of you to explore your relationship dynamics, understand each other's perspectives, and learn healthier ways of communicating and resolving conflicts.

Remember that healing a strained relationship takes time and effort from both parties involved. It's important to approach this process with empathy, patience, and willingness to change.

The emotions that you are both experiencing during conflicts are intense. Shouting and name calling are not ways of getting your point across or receiving support in the way that you would like. If you and your daughter are willing to work on this together, you can absolutely improve your relationship by developing healthier forms of communication. It is crucial to be honest with one another and truly express how you feel. Each person may do this differently or may feel that the other is not listening to their thoughts and emotions. and creating common goals for your relationship do exist and this is a common area to focus on in therapy.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I want to assure you that you are not alone. Many people experience these thoughts and feelings, and I'm here to support you through them. It's important to remember that negative self-talk can be harsh and unforgiving, often not reflecting the reality of who you truly are. 

Firstly, I want to remind you that beauty comes in many forms, and it is not solely based on external appearance. It's important to focus on your unique qualities, strengths, and the positive aspects of yourself that make you who you are. 

As for feeling stupid or useless, it's crucial to recognize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes, we tend to focus more on our shortcomings rather than appreciating our skills and accomplishments. Take some time to acknowledge the things you are good at and the achievements you've made, no matter how big or small they may seem.

Feeling like you can't make anyone happy can be tough, but it's important to remember that your worth isn't solely determined by your ability to please others. Happiness is subjective and can't be solely depended on another person. Focus on nurturing genuine connections and relationships with loved ones, but also allow yourself to prioritize your own well-being and happiness.

If these feelings persist and are impacting your daily life, it might be helpful to seek professional support. A therapist or counselor can offer guidance and strategies to improve your self-esteem and help you develop healthier thought patterns

Question: 
My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me "Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me," and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.
REAL ANSWER: 
It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem, and the short answer is that you can't do anything about it, only she can. We can't change what other people say, think, or do. We can only change our reactions. It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time. You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy. You can reassure her that you like her (if that's true), but you don't have to pity her.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It sounds like you are in a difficult situation with your roommate, and I appreciate you reaching out for support. Dealing with someone who has a drinking problem can be challenging, especially when their behavior impacts your daily life. It's important to remember that you are not responsible for your roommate's actions or emotions, but it's understandable that you might want to help. 

Firstly, it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being. Living in a situation where you constantly feel pressured to validate your roommate's emotions can be emotionally exhausting for you. It's okay to set boundaries and let her know when her behavior is affecting you negatively. 

Encourage your roommate to seek professional help for her drinking problem and her mental health concerns. Professional counselors or therapists have the skills and experience to provide the necessary support. Help her understand that reaching out for help is a courageous step towards improving her overall well-being. 

Additionally, you can suggest support groups or resources specifically targeted towards individuals dealing with addiction and mental health issues. These communities can offer her a space to connect with people who are going through similar experiences and provide additional guidance and understanding.

Lastly, remember that you cannot fix your roommate's problems on your own. You can be there to lend emotional support, but she ultimately needs to take responsibility for her actions and seek the help she needs. Encourage her to rely on a support network, and suggest that she build connections with friends, family, or professionals who can provide assistance during this challenging time.

Your roommate's drinking may not be the cause of her troubles; it is more likely a symptom of something that happened in the past that she is reactively "self-medicating."It is almost equally likely that no matter who she lived with, the same troubles would crop up. You harbour resentments against her and it is possible your answers to her would be "No" to her queries of whether you hate her. Even pitying her is passive aggressive, because deep down she knows your behaviour towards her is condescending and she is reacting accordingly.Our therapist would suggest you lovingly set boundaries arouond your own limits to how often and in what way you will "rescue" her.

Question: 
I'm in my early 20s. I’ve been married once, and he cheated on me. Ever since then, I've felt ugly no matter what. I'm engaged, and I still feel ugly. I don't like to take pictures of myself.
REAL ANSWER: 
Sounds as though you're taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husband.He did an ugly action, and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on, you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling it.Does this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incident?You may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt. It is possible there is more suffering within you than you've realized until now.As you address all the emotional pain you've lived through, the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own. Because you'd be focused on you, not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way. It's common for experiences like infidelity to have a lasting impact on our self-esteem and how we perceive ourselves. Remember, though, that your worth and beauty are not defined by someone else's actions or opinions.

Taking a step back, it's important to recognize that beauty is subjective and goes beyond physical appearance. True beauty lies in your unique qualities, strengths, and the way you treat others. Those are the things that make you truly special and valuable.

It might also be helpful to explore and challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs you hold about yourself. They may stem from the pain and betrayal you experienced in your previous marriage. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through these emotions and build your self-confidence.

In the meantime, try to engage in self-care activities that make you feel good about yourself. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who appreciate and value you for who you genuinely are. Remember to embrace your achievements, and focus on things you like about yourself rather than dwelling on the negatives.

Keep in mind that healing takes time, and everyone's journey is unique. It's important to be patient with yourself and give yourself the space to heal and rediscover your self-worth.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Thank you for your question. A significant event, such your husband cheating, is enough to drastically affect someone’s self-esteem and self-worth. However, self-worth does not have to come from external factors like our appearance; it is an internal self-belief system. Self-worth has more to do with how we value, accept and approve of ourselves. Is that something that you struggle with? I would suggest that you focus on the things about yourself that you like and make a daily intention to remind yourself of these things. Having positive affirmations and post-it notes of  around your space is helpful so you have reminders. You can also work with a helping professional to challenge old, negative self-beliefs and develop new ones. Attached is also a worksheet on self-worth that might be useful.Finally, because you seem to link your worthiness to how you look physically, positive thinking alone may not be enough. Ask yourself where does this required/need for approval actually come from? Are you seeking the approval of others or even yourself? These are some other areas of exploration with your therapist. To challenge yourself to feel “worthy” in new ways, I also encourage you to do one thing in a week or month that takes the focus off your worthiness coming from your body or outside sources of validation and, instead works on feeling confident internally and connected to your body. Consider connecting with a therapist around exploring some of this. Also, have a clothes swap to celebrate the way that

Question: 
I was in a relationship for almost five years. We were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship. He was a caring, friendly, and charming guy up until three and a half years in. He started controlling me: who I hung out with, where I was at all times, and he had a huge hissy fit if I tried to ask him the same questions. All that time, he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my so-called friends. At the end, he was a nasty and narcissistic person. Now it’s hard to be social.
REAL ANSWER: 
It sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship, and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people. It is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships, we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with others.Therapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships, to unpack what happened in prior relationships, and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want. Often, relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them, enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you went through such a difficult experience. It can be incredibly painful when someone we care about changes and becomes controlling or abusive in a relationship. It's natural to feel hurt, betrayed, and hesitant to trust others after going through such an ordeal.

It's important to remember that the way your ex treated you says more about him than it does about you. Controlling and narcissistic behavior is not acceptable, and it's not a reflection of your worth or value as a person. Recognizing this can be the first step in healing and moving forward.

When it comes to being social again, it's understandable to feel cautious and guarded. Take your time to heal and rebuild your self-esteem. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can provide a safe space for you to open up and share your feelings. Consider seeking counseling or talking to a therapist who can help you work through the emotional aftermath of the relationship.

Remember, healing takes time, and everyone's journey is different. Be patient with yourself as you navigate through the healing process. In time, you will find the strength to trust again and form healthy social connections.

Question: 
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.
REAL ANSWER: 
I suggest that you work on emotional awareness. Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.

I understand that feeling anger easily can be frustrating, especially when you feel like you have no control over it. It's great that you are seeking suggestions for managing your anger. Here are a few techniques that might be helpful:

1. Identify triggers: Pay attention to the situations, people, or thoughts that tend to provoke your anger. By identifying your triggers, you can be better prepared to manage your response when they occur.

2. Practice deep breathing: When you notice yourself becoming angry, take slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce the intensity of your anger response.

3. Use relaxation techniques: Engage in activities that help you relax, such as meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation. Regular practice of these techniques can help reduce overall stress levels, making it easier to manage anger.

4. Seek support: Consider talking to a counselor or therapist who can provide guidance and support in managing your anger. They can help you explore the underlying causes of your anger and develop coping strategies tailored to your specific needs.

5. Communicate assertively: Instead of reacting impulsively, try expressing your anger in a calm and assertive manner. Use "I" statements to express how you feel and what you need, without blaming or attacking others. This can help prevent misunderstandings and find solutions to conflicts.

6. Take a break: If you feel anger

Hello there. I am glad you are able to recognize when you are becoming angry. That is a step in the right direction. I also think it may be useful to practice spending some time within a session to see if you recognize the beginning of the event. And that is knowing yourself and being in touch with yourself if you have a specific definition of what that looks like when it is beginning.To be in touch with what the feeling of anger feels like in your body so you have an idea of what's happening before a blow up occurs. That you practice angry and in and blow by blow fashion so you have choices available to you before you actually go to the circumstance.

Question: 
I've pretty much been on my own since day one, I'm a middle child of five, and I can't seem to put my trust in anyone. It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend. Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again. I really want some help.
REAL ANSWER: 
One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention back.Start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate. You'll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of self-reminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm sorry to hear that you've had a difficult time putting your trust in others and opening up to people. It's not uncommon to struggle with building trust, especially if you've been on your own for a long time. It's great that you were able to open up to your best friend, even if it took a while. That's a positive step forward.

When it comes to developing feelings for someone and then pushing them away, it could be a defense mechanism to protect yourself from potential hurt or rejection. It's understandable that you might be afraid of getting close to someone and being vulnerable.

To start addressing this issue, it might be helpful to explore the root causes of your trust issues and fear of opening up to others. This could be done through therapy or counseling, where you can work with a professional to understand the underlying factors and develop strategies for building trust.

In the meantime, here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Take gradual steps: Instead of completely shutting people out, try taking small steps towards opening up. Share a little bit about your thoughts or feelings with someone you feel comfortable with.

2. Reflect on your fears: Take some time to reflect on what specifically makes you afraid of getting close to someone or being vulnerable. Understanding your fears better can help you develop coping strategies.

3. Challenge negative beliefs: It's possible that you have negative beliefs about trust and relationships that are influencing your behavior. Challenge these beliefs and try to replace them with more positive and

To develop a trust in others start with one person at a time. You say you opened up a little bit to your best friend, that's a start.

Your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him again.Otherwise how would you actually know whether he's lying to you now or not?Start the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truth.If he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I understand how difficult it can be to navigate a situation where trust has been broken in the past. It's natural to feel unsure and skeptical, even if the person has made changes. Trust takes time to rebuild, and it's important to give yourself permission to feel cautious.

It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your doubts and concerns. Expressing your feelings and fears can promote dialogue and enable both of you to work towards rebuilding trust. It's important for him to understand how his past actions have impacted you and for you to understand his perspective as well.

While he may not have done anything recently to break your trust, it's also important to make sure that you're observing consistent behaviors over time. Trust isn't just built on one incident but on repeated actions that demonstrate reliability, honesty, and transparency.

Ultimately, the decision to stay or go is something only you can make. It's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being and consider if you can see a future where trust can be fully restored. If doubts and mistrust continue to persist, it might be beneficial to seek couples counseling or individual therapy to help explore these feelings and gain further clarity.

Remember, trust rebuilding is a gradual process, and it's crucial to be patient with yourself and your partner. Trust can be regained, but it requires openness, communication, and consistent efforts from both parties involved.

Trust and intimacy are closely related and go hand in hand. Trust is a building block of a healthy relationship. Your current doubts may be due to your lack of trust. If your boyfriend is now being honest about different areas of his life and changing for the better then I’d say you have improvement to work on from the past, him having lied to you, but I’m not hearing any current reason for mistrust. It may be you would be better off working with a relationship coach, or even going to couples counseling to help you both move forward toward a trusting relationship. Also, trust is always earned, so he is building trust back each and every day and month he is working to be honest with you. Earning back trust won’t happen overnight.

Question: 
My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriends/lovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts. It causes me to get jealous because I'm afraid they might reconnect somehow. I've attempted to talk to her about it, but she avoids it and doesn't seem to worry about how I feel about it.
REAL ANSWER: 
Talking about it would probably be helpful if you're both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important. It may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time. You can adjust the timing for what works for both of you. After one of you is talking, perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say. This can lessen confusion.I know you say that she avoids it. It might be a good place to start talking about it – to see what makes her avoid it. It could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she can't talk to them. I don't know how you typically react when you are jealous, but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing, that may be helpful as well.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I can understand why this situation is making you feel jealous and concerned. It's normal to have some degree of discomfort when our current partners maintain close relationships with their exes. However, it's important to approach this issue with open communication and empathy.

When talking to your girlfriend about your concerns, try to create a safe space for an open conversation. Express your feelings calmly and honestly, making sure she understands that you're not trying to control her or dictate her friendships. Let her know that you trust her, but you would appreciate some reassurance or understanding about your worries.

It's also essential to be open to her perspective. Ask her to share her thoughts and feelings regarding her friendships with her exes. Listen to her without judgment and try to understand why she values these connections. It's possible that she sees them purely as friends without any romantic intentions.

Ultimately, it comes down to establishing some healthy boundaries that both of you are comfortable with. Discuss what actions or behaviors would make you feel more at ease, such as limiting public displays of affection on social media or having more open conversations about their interactions. Remember that compromise is key in any relationship.

If your girlfriend continues to avoid the conversation and disregards your feelings, it might be worth exploring deeper communication issues within the relationship. A relationship should be built on mutual respect and understanding. If these core elements are lacking, it's important to address them together or seek couples counseling for further assistance.

Remember, jealousy is a natural emotion, but managing

Are they friends on any other social media networks or is this just limited to Facebook. If it's just to Facebook, I would say, relax a little bit. If she still wanted to be with them, she could reach out through a private message or a number of other ways. But most likely, especially if they can talk about stuff in front of you, she is just reconnecting with some old friends.Also, would you say that you are noticing any other signs of her pushing you away or is this really the only behavior that is concerning to you.An interesting thing that happens in relationships is that when we feel close to someone, we open up emotionally and rely on the other person to meet more and more of our needs (and we are supposed to do the same for the other person). For example, it is really common for people to need their partner to be there for them when they are sad or stressed. While there are some things we can do to help for our partner in some of those cases, ultimately, if the relationship can't do anything to meet those needs, our friends can only help so much and if we don't know how to meet our own emotional needs, going to the friend is only temporarily going to help.This is a long way of saying, some of the things you are looking for may just not be the things a romantic partner can do. While it would be nice to want them to do those things and she could at any point decide to meet some of

Question: 
I crave attention, companionship, and sex. She has had a hysterectomy, and she has a bad knee.
REAL ANSWER: 
Hi Hampton,Although I'd bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship, it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now. I also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you. This is a very common issue; two people with different sexual drives or needs. If you both want the relationship to improve, a couple's therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea; it's a complex picture that you've only given us a glimpse of.In the meantime, you can try a few things: have compassion for your wife. She's in pain and this may preoccupy her. Sex may be uncomfortable for her. She needs understanding. You need understanding too, right? Help her to see that you're not just angry, but lonely and hurt; it might affect how you see yourself as a man. Showing her irritability or anger might push her farther away.There are many ways to be close, intimate, and sexual that don't involve intercourse. You might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you won't pressure her to have intercourse. Find out what your wife's wishes and ideas are. You might be surprised.These things take time to address, especially if they've been years in the making. I do recommend seeing that therapist. Relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change. Best of luck.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It sounds like you're experiencing a strong desire for attention, companionship, and intimacy, which is completely normal and understandable. However, it seems there may be some additional challenges involved, such as your partner having had a hysterectomy and a bad knee.

When it comes to feeling a lack of attention, communication with your partner is crucial. Express your needs and desires openly and honestly, and try to find a middle ground that works for both of you. It's important to remember that attention and companionship can be expressed in various ways, beyond just physical intimacy.

Regarding your partner's health issues, it's essential to show empathy and understanding. Having a hysterectomy and a bad knee can impact a person physically and emotionally. It may be helpful to have an open conversation about how these health issues affect her and what adjustments can be made to accommodate both of your needs.

Additionally, exploring alternative forms of intimate connection that don't put additional strain on your partner's health may be beneficial. This might include exploring different ways to create closeness, such as cuddling, sharing intimate conversation, or engaging in activities that you both enjoy. Remember, intimacy can be expressed in various ways beyond just sex.

Overall, effective communication, empathy, and understanding are key in navigating these challenges together. If the issues persist, it may be beneficial to seek the guidance of a professional counselor who can help you both explore these concerns further.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
It sounds like you're trying to find a different focus for your energy while your wife recovers from these things - is that correct? Sex isn't the primary focus in a relationship, and sometimes this is easy to forget or to set that aside when there has been an injury or medical issue. The first thing women often need when they're recovering from something is the chance to feel that their partners empathize with the issues (can you show her that you understand her pain or what she's going through?). Sometimes, simply offering hands on (non-sexual) nurturing and care is enough for a time while the other person feels unwell or in pain. If this is something you can offer, it can be a really good way to "connect" for a bit even in the absence of sex. If you were to offer a 10 or 15 minute foot massage, for example, you get to have physical contact and attention on her and you get to "be there" for her in the ways that you want without making any extra demands such as she focus on your attention rather than the pain she's facing right now. Often, sex is something offered and received within the context of love and caregiving, so this can be a good way to stay connected overall.If you genuinely have needs for attention and companionship that go beyond that, then it may be healthy to let her know what those are. Perhaps while you make dinner, she can sit with you and you can catch up with each

Raw GPT Answer: 
Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concern. It's important to remember that what is considered "normal" can vary from person to person and couple to couple. Sexual frequency can be influenced by a variety of factors such as individual preferences, physical and emotional well-being, and relationship dynamics.

However, it can be helpful to assess whether both you and your partner are satisfied with your current level of intimacy. Open and honest communication is key in any relationship. Have a calm and non-judgmental conversation with your partner about your needs, desires, and expectations regarding physical intimacy.

By having this discussion, you can better understand each other's perspectives and find a compromise that aligns with both of your needs. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy and respect, as everyone's desires and libido can vary.

If you find it challenging to discuss or if the discrepancy in sexual frequency is causing distress or strain in your relationship, it may be worth considering seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in couples' therapy. They can provide guidance and support in navigating this issue.

Remember, relationships are unique, and what matters most is both partners feeling satisfied, respected, and loved.

That's great that you're looking at comparing your relationship to that of others around you, that's an important step toward recognizing problem areas that can ultimately lead to some sort of change that serves you both in the long term! Although there are research statistics on "what's normal," the bottom line is that every couple is different. What's perhaps more important than thinking about whether you are closer to the "norm" (whatever that means), is considering what is best for you and your partner. Meadows, House & Van Den Berghe (2009) found that frequency of sex was not a good indicator of relationship satisfaction for both married and cohabitating couples (i.e. those who live together but are unmarried). However, for dating couples, sexual frequency was an accurate reflection of their satisfaction! So in a way, the level of satisfaction that you both feel about having sex once a month is the measure of how "normal" that is in your relationship.But here's a little more about the frequency of sexual activity in relationships. Wynne, West, Gaines & ,s (2007) did a pretty exhaustive review of the literature examining sexual frequency in long term relationships for couples with the following age ranges : 18-49, 31-80, 45-89. Here's what they found:-Average frequency for couples between the ages of 18-29: About 112 times per year.-Average frequency for couples between the ages of 30-49: About 86

Question: 
I spent my whole life taking care of my dad, but left because of his verbally abusive behavior. I was the only one that helped with his health issues. I feel if I hadn't left he might still be alive. I need help dealing with my grief and guilty conscience.
REAL ANSWER: 
I see such a sharp contrast between your question and your first sentence. Do you see it? "I feel guilty about my father's death", and "I spent my WHOLE LIFE taking care of my dad." Wow. After everyone else had left him to his misery, you hung in there. He is so lucky to have had you there. You didn't have to do that. I have a hunch that your dad blamed you for a lot of things. Abusive people do that a lot; they make you believe things are your fault when they're not. You did the opposite of what you fear you did. You didn't contribute to your dad's death; your selfless care gave him a longer life...better health. In the end, no one's love and care could save him. No one could fault you for deciding you had had enough at some point. I would never expect anyone to keep putting themselves in a hurting place over and over again. But this is what you did. You did it for him, and you did it so you wouldn't feel guilty. But you feel guilty anyway, right?...so putting yourself in that position was only worth it if you allow your loving acts to melt away the guilt. Can you tell yourself "It's okay that I had to take care of myself too."... "I gave up a lot for my dad; I have nothing to feel guilty about".Putting yourself last for your dad was a loving thing to do. And... my hope is that you can also find different ways to help yourself feel "good enough" in this world, and a balance between caring for others and caring for yourself. :)

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear about the loss of your dad, and I can understand how difficult it must be for you to carry this burden of guilt and grief. It's important to remember that everyone has their limits, and it sounds like you reached yours due to your dad's verbally abusive behavior. Taking care of someone with health issues can be emotionally exhausting, and it's understandable that you needed to prioritize your own well-being.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you are not responsible for your dad's passing. There are many factors that contribute to a person's health, and it's not fair to blame yourself entirely. Grief can often make us feel like we could have done more, but it's essential to show yourself compassion and remind yourself that you did what you could during a difficult time.

It may be helpful for you to find a support system to help you process your emotions and guilt. Consider reaching out to a therapist or a support group where you can share your feelings in a safe and understanding environment. They can provide guidance, empathy, and help you find healthy ways to cope with your grief.

Additionally, practicing self-care is crucial during this time. Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and joy, spend time with loved ones who understand and support you, and be patient with yourself as you navigate through the healing process.

Remember, healing takes time. Allow yourself to grieve and process your

Question: 
My boyfriend and I recently broke up. One week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. He completely deleted me out of his life. He does have an opiate addiction. He claimed he was sober, but since we've split, I've heard many lies from him. Could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind?
REAL ANSWER: 
Studies have proven that addiction affects the brain, there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well. I would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns. Not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals. Being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when re-engaging in personal relationships.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm truly sorry to hear about your breakup and the challenges you're currently facing. Addiction can be a difficult and complex issue that affects both the individual experiencing it and those close to them. While I can't speak directly to your ex-boyfriend's situation, it is possible that he may be using again if you've noticed signs of him lying and exhibiting behaviors consistent with his past addiction.

Substance addiction can have a profound impact on an individual's mental and emotional well-being. Drugs like opiates can alter brain chemistry, impair judgment, and contribute to changes in behavior. Addiction can also lead to secrecy, isolation, and strained relationships.

Remember, it is not your responsibility to diagnose or manage your ex-boyfriend's addiction. However, it may be helpful for you to focus on your own well-being during this time. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, and consider seeking your own professional help, such as counseling, to help you process your feelings and navigate this difficult situation.

If you're concerned about your ex-boyfriend's well-being, you might encourage him to seek professional help or share your concerns with someone close to him who could offer support. It's important to take care of yourself while also understanding that you cannot control someone else's choices or actions.

Please remember that it's completely normal to feel a range of emotions after a breakup. Take things one day at a time, be patient with yourself, and give yourself time to heal.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Regina, There’s little we can do to figure out if your man is using again but I think you hit the nail on the head in your intuition that something is driving a wedge between you when you say: “does this addiction affect the mind?” Addiction affects the mind. They need to use and if that jeopardizes a relationship – well, sometimes that gets ignored. You need to focus on moving. I hope you can find some support to wade through the sadness – a good therapist would be great. Go. Fix. Yourself!

Question: 
I have been dating my ex-boyfriend’s cousin for a few years. We have gotten pretty serious. He wants to cut it off because people are giving him a hard time that our kids will be related to my ex.
REAL ANSWER: 
Does your boyfriend agree with the other people's opinions or is the problem that he feels that doing what they want will be an easy way to stop hearing them say what he doesn't like hearing?Talk through whether he actually believes what the others are telling him or figures that complying will make them stop bothering him.Once the two of you understand what, if any, the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status, you'll be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I can understand that this situation may be causing a lot of stress for you and your current boyfriend. It's important to remember that familial relationships and societal expectations can often complicate our decisions about dating and relationships.

First and foremost, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings and concerns. Try to understand his perspective and the reasons why he feels the need to break up. In these conversations, it's important to listen without judgment and acknowledge his feelings, even if you may not agree with them.

Consider discussing the long-term implications of your relationship – specifically, the impact it may have on your children. You may find it helpful to discuss how you plan to address any potential challenges that may arise due to their familial connection to your ex. Showing that you're willing to address these concerns and work together as a team may help alleviate your boyfriend's worries.

Ultimately, the decision to continue or end the relationship should be based on careful consideration of both parties' feelings, values, and expectations. It may be helpful to seek guidance from a professional counselor or therapist who can provide clearer insight into your specific situation.

Remember, relationships can be complicated, and it's important to prioritize honest communication, empathy, and understanding.

Depending on your answer, you may want to move on between many people who are open to you.Identify in the beginning, and keep this front and center in your mind, that whom you invite into your life is your privilege.

Question: 
My mom and I have been fighting a lot now, and I just want a good relationship with her.
REAL ANSWER: 
The best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively. One of the hardest things about this, however, is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the all-or-nothing blame. The best style of communication is open and asking for clarification; why not try asking your mother why this particular fight/situation is eliciting such an angry response. Often, the simple act of expressing that we don't understand the other person's point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication. The hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulties with your mom. It's completely normal to want a positive and nurturing relationship with your parents. Conflict can arise for various reasons, and it can be challenging to navigate through it. Here are a few suggestions that might help improve your relationship:

1. Open and honest communication: Try expressing your thoughts and feelings to your mom in a calm and assertive manner. Use "I" statements to avoid sounding accusatory and give her an opportunity to share her perspective as well.

2. Active listening: Show your mom that you're trying to understand her point of view by actively listening. Paraphrase what she says to ensure you're on the same page. This can help prevent misunderstandings and show that you respect her thoughts.

3. Empathy and understanding: Try to put yourself in your mom's shoes and empathize with her feelings and experiences. This can help create a sense of connection and foster understanding between both of you.

4. Problem-solving: Instead of engaging in heated arguments, focus on finding solutions together. Identify the underlying issues causing the conflicts and work towards resolving them as a team. This approach can help create a cooperative and supportive atmosphere.

5. Seek professional help: If the conflicts persist and become too difficult to manage on your own, consider seeking assistance from a family therapist or counselor. A neutral third party can provide guidance and mediation to help improve communication and strengthen your relationship.

Remember, building a healthy relationship takes time, effort,

Commit to sticking a pause to an argument when it can feel a little calmer. You can tell your mom(same as you can tell yourself) that even though you'd really love to fix this problem right this second, it's difficult to know how to fix this problem when both people are very upset and yelling(or however difficult it is). And then you can find a length of time you both agree will help you get calm(so you can stick to it) and once you're calm, basically you can go back to the part that you each got upset, and navigate through that part calmly.Understand that by even telling her this, you're basically taking responsibility for doing your part in this. You can direct her to this post or repeat it if she basically doesn't make an effort to be calm. But you will benefit the most out of this by staying calm yourself and committing to that part of the solution's process.

Question: 
I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him.
   The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. In my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.
REAL ANSWER: 
Hi. I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children. Children need adults around them to act maturely, cooperatively and peacefully even when they don't like each other; it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your ex-boyfriend seems more focused on his own needs. In fact, he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive, controlling and manipulative, bordering on 'parental alienation'. I agree this is a problem.I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. It's not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honour this instinct you have. I will suggest a few things to you. First, to gather support around you, professionally if you need it, from family and friends, and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex, that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.Know that your ex's behaviours aren't happening because you did anything wrong; it's the way he operates (and maybe this is why you're not with him?). You can't change him, but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. You're correct that he will always be there, and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.Keep on defining clear boundaries! You might sound like a broken record ("You'll have to talk to my husband about that"), but that's okay. It's okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. It's okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren't vitally important. It's okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. It's okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you, I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are, simply and clearly and in writing ("our agreement states X, and you are not following our agreement"). Your daughter doesn't have to be aware; I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.A professional therapist can help you with all of this. I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace, at least within yourself. :)

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through. It can be incredibly challenging to navigate co-parenting with multiple individuals involved. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling overwhelmed by the constant drama and the impact it has on the children involved.

It sounds like you genuinely want to minimize conflicts and prioritize the well-being of the children, which is commendable. However, despite your efforts, it seems that tensions still arise. It's understandable that you feel frustrated and confused about where things went wrong.

One step you can take is to have a calm and open conversation with your ex-boyfriend (and potentially your husband as well) about establishing clear boundaries. This includes defining what responsibilities and decision-making powers each person has regarding the children. It might be helpful to involve a mediator or a professional counselor who specializes in co-parenting dynamics to facilitate these discussions.

It's also important to remember that in situations like these, emotions can run high. Try to separate yourself from the drama as much as possible and focus on what you can control, such as your own reactions and prioritizing the well-being of your daughter.

Lastly, it might be beneficial for you to seek support for yourself, either through therapy or a support group. Talking to professionals or others who have experienced similar situations can provide you with guidance, coping strategies, and a safe space to vent and process your emotions.

Remember, it's not your fault that these conflicts are occurring, and your focus should continue

How fortunate you have two little girls in your life.First, it would be a kind thought for you to become willing to accept and tolerate tension and confusion in your life when your ex, your current husband, and all the children are part of one another's lives. Even the best of plans can go awry.With this as your attitude, you may be less likely to expect whatever stressors become part of your interactions to go away immediately.Next is there any way you can talk with these two other adults to make a plan of who will do what and when?This plan will save you from details of picking up and dropping of the girls which don't pertain to you. Also, it may lessen the awkwardness your other two partners may feel when dealing with one another. What may be an unexpected glitch is that by specifying who does what with the girls, your ex and partner may be less willing to alter this approach, even when circumstances warrant it. To give up "doing your own thing" in some areas may be the hardest to do for most people. Twice a year, my alma mater has a big college basketball game on campus.

Question: 
I'm feeling different towards my husband. I feel I am growing from the relationship. I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five. I just don't feel that connection anymore. I feel nothing. I don't know why or if I'm just being irrational.
REAL ANSWER: 
, I'm SO glad you wrote. Thousands of people are having this same feeling right now. I'm glad you're paying attention to it. When you first meet someone, there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection. Then what happens is because we have that connection established, we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we don't have to work hard to earn their love anymore. That sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years (long enough to procreate and keep the human race going), and then it wears off a bit, and you end up looking at each other thinking "how come I don't feel the same anymore?"Mostly (not always, and I'll get to that in a minute) all that this means is you've stopped doing all those loving things you used to do! It's as though you filled the car with gas, you've run out of gas now, and you're forgetting to put more in!The first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that you've cut back on. Act lovingly, and you will likely regain those feelings. Talk to your partner about this. It's okay to say "do you remember we used to do X,Y and Z? Can we do that again? Can I get more of the foot rubs you used to give me?" Ask for what you want (instead of complaining). What are your 'love languages'? What are your partner's? Marriages need to be fed. It's that simple. Many things get in the way...children, jobs, but mostly complacency. Get active with your love!Okay, now, you might read this and think "that's not what's happening". That's a cue to talk to someone, like a therapist, about your feelings. People do grow and change and sometimes relationships don't fit anymore. But these are huge decisions, not to be made lightly. I wish you happiness.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It's completely normal to experience fluctuations in your feelings towards your partner over the course of a long-term relationship. It's important not to feel guilty or irrational about these changing emotions. It's worth exploring what may be causing this shift in your connection. Has anything major changed in your lives recently, such as stressful events or significant life changes? It could be helpful to communicate openly and honestly with your husband about your feelings and concerns. A heart-to-heart conversation can provide insight into each other's perspectives and potentially help in finding ways to reconnect and understand each other better. Additionally, seeking professional help from a couples therapist may be beneficial in navigating this phase and finding ways to rekindle the connection. Remember, relationships require effort and commitment from both partners to flourish.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
We hear you. Feeling as though you're falling out of love or growing apart is extremely painful. So is not being able to pinpoint why you feel the way you do. It's common to notice an ebb and flow in long-term relationships; just because you're not feeling very connected right doesn't necessarily mean things are doomed. It could be that other stressors are or have been consuming and/or distracting you right now and you haven't had a chance to connect much lately; give it some time. It's also possible the intimacy and connection you're craving doesn't need to come from your marriage alone, but from other relationships, too. Finally, it's conceivable this could be an early sign of marital drift. If you're willing and able, you might want to share how you're feeling with your husband so you're both on the same page. If there are other stressors happening right now (e.g., job change, health problems, death in the family, move, bad insomnia), those could be raising the intensity of your negative emotions and possibly magnifying the way you see your husband and your marriage. If these emotions persist or are getting stronger, you may want to talk with a couple's counselor to further explore your feelings and thoughts within the context of your marriage. They should be able to help you identify any patterns of thinking and behaving that might be exacerbating the issue and may have resources and suggestions for addressing them. Either way, it's important that you tend to

I've been bulimic for about 6 years now. I'm in my early 20s. I am about to start back to school to become an RN, and I really need to get better once and for all.    I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?

Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style you're already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of self-doubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where you'd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you've been struggling with bulimia for such a long time. It takes a lot of strength to recognize that you need help and to reach out for support. I want to commend you for taking the initiative to seek assistance.

The first step towards recovery is to reach out to a professional. I would strongly encourage you to find a therapist or counselor who specializes in eating disorders. They can provide you with the guidance and support you need on your journey to recovery. They will be able to help you understand the underlying reasons behind your behavior, develop coping mechanisms, and work towards changing your relationship with food.

Additionally, it might be beneficial to consult your primary care physician. They can assess your physical health and provide any necessary medical interventions or referrals to specialists, such as nutritionists or dietitians.

Building a support network can also be invaluable during your recovery. Consider confiding in a trusted friend or family member who can offer you emotional support and encouragement along the way. You may also want to explore support groups, both online and offline, where you can connect with others who have similar experiences.

Remember, recovery is a process, and it takes time and effort. It's important to be patient and kind to yourself as you embark on this path. Celebrate small victories and seek help whenever needed. You deserve to live a happy and healthy life, and I truly believe that with the right support and determination, you can overcome this obstacle and achieve your goals.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are highly effective in helping treat eating and body image issues. Make sure you find someone trained on using these approaches to eating disorders since they are not only found in specialists. Find a therapist with whom you can build a strong therapeutic alliance, willing to push you out of your comfort zone on the context of respect and understanding of your approach to your difficulties. Finally, seek help now and keep the therapists business card. Many providers are not able to accommodate changes in insurance status and have limited sliding fee schedule availabiliy in their offices, so once you have made the personal and financial commitment to start the journey to recovery, make sure you do not let a pesky logistic issue derail it.

At the same time, we already have values which are rooted in those from the family in which we grew up.Your dilemma of wanting to be with this boy shows there is a clash between your values as an individual, including your choice of partner, and the way your family understands the values which support being part of a couple.Stay true to what you feel, whether this comes from your family or the way you currently are evolving.This will guarantee that your new relationship will be built on the values and person you truly are.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It's completely understandable that you may have concerns about what your friends and family may think about your dating choices. It's important to remember that ultimately, the decision of who you choose to be with is yours, and it should be based on your own feelings and happiness rather than solely on the opinions of others.

If you're interested in pursuing a relationship with this boy, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. Express your feelings and fears, and see if the two of you can find ways to navigate through any potential challenges together.

When it comes to sharing the news with your friends and family, it can be helpful to ease into the conversation gradually. Start by sharing positive aspects about this person and emphasize the qualities that drew you to them. It might also be helpful to communicate your own desire for happiness and fulfillment, and explain that you believe this relationship has the potential to provide that for you.

Remember, some people might need time to adjust to the idea, and that's okay. Give them the opportunity to understand and accept your choice at their own pace. Ultimately, what matters most is that you follow your heart and make choices that bring you joy and fulfillment in your life.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
I have been in this EXACT situation before! First off- it is hard to go against the norm of what everyone else is doing because there is comfort in numbers. Your friends and family love you, and they will likely either come around to accepting it or they may not. Often times people in our lives are unaware of how judgmental they are being. When we accept ourselves despite the judgment of others this is one of the most freeing experiences we can have. If someone in your life can't accept you for who you are they really aren't worth having in your life anyways. There will also always be other people who will support you. I love the Dr.Seuss quote “Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.” What comes through though is that whatever your decision is make sure that is YOURS. Also- think about which person do you know that you would let hold your hand, hug you, kiss you, get close to you if everyone else in the world was blind? This will help clue you in to which choice you truly want to make. , MA, NCC

Question: 
I met this girl in high school. She had switched schools at the end of the year, and I have not seen her since. It's been a few years. We had a very good and friendly relationship, and we seemed to have a lot in common. I never gained the courage to ask her out.
REAL ANSWER: 
One way to make good use of the situation you describe is to prepare and rehearse within yourself the way you'd handle a similar situation in the future.Since a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis, right now you've got no idea if you'd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years ago.The relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner. That you liked the friendliness you shared is good for you to recognize. This way you realize you like friendship as a relationship property. To have lots of similar interests, is another quality you appreciate in a partner.The more you know about what you do and don't like in a partner, the greater your chance to notice these qualities in someone new who comes along your path.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It sounds like you had a meaningful connection with this girl in high school. It's natural to feel a sense of regret about not asking her out, especially if you had a lot in common and enjoyed each other's company. It's important to remember that missed opportunities happen to everyone at some point in their lives.

Although you may not have asked her out in high school, it's never too late to reach out and reconnect with her. Social media platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn can be great resources for finding and connecting with old friends. If you're interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her, it might be worth taking the risk and reaching out to see if she is open to reconnecting.

However, keep in mind that she may have moved on and her feelings towards you might have changed over the years. It's important not to go into this with expectations or put pressure on her to reciprocate your feelings. Approach the conversation as an opportunity to catch up and reminisce, and see where things naturally lead from there.

If you do reach out, be genuine and honest about your intentions. Let her know that you enjoyed your friendship in high school and that you've always wondered what could have happened if you had asked her out. Be prepared for any response she may give, including the possibility that she may not be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship.

Remember, it's never too late to take a chance and try to reconnect with someone from your past. Regardless of the outcome, you'll

What do you fear?Why didn't you want to date her when she was in the area?What do you love about life that you're using your mental energy to fantasize about someone you barely knew many years ago who lived too far from you to date?There is something about your current life you are actively hiding from your mind, that by spending the time you do on this girl you'll discover.Don't worry about being dead inside. Worry about your lack of courage and honesty to get to know the real you, who is trying to get your attention.

Question: 
My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction. We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant. I don't know what to do to fix the relationship.
REAL ANSWER: 
My empathy goes out to you. Relationships are tough enough and i'm sure your partner being distant has been upsetting for you. You are confused and want to mend the relationship with him, but are finding it so hard to do. Relationships require both people to work consistently in order to keep them happier, but if it is only you that is actively trying to repair the relationship, it can be emotionally draining. Perhaps expressing you feel using I, you statements can be beneficial. Do not accuse him or use "you" statements like "you are so distant" or "you don't even care".Start out sharing your feelings by saying "I feel sad when you don't return my phone calls" or "I feel confused about our relationship ever since you have been keeping to yourself". He may have a valid point, or might have been hurt by the argument and retreated as a result of it. Regardless of why, use this time as a great opportunity to practice healthy communication. If you think you are not ready for a conversation like that, couples counseling can be excellent. You will have a skilled facilitator guide the conversation and help you both communicate with one another.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through a difficult time in your relationship. It's important to remember that during recovery, emotions can be overwhelming for both parties, and conflicts might arise more easily. Here are a few suggestions to help you navigate this situation:

1. Communicate openly and honestly: Express your concerns to your boyfriend in a calm and compassionate manner. Use "I" statements to avoid sounding accusatory. Ask him how he's feeling and give him space to share his thoughts and emotions.

2. Show empathy and understanding: It's essential to be supportive and patient during this challenging period. Understand that recovery is a continuous process, and setbacks or emotional distancing are part of the healing journey. Let him know that you're there for him and willing to work through the difficulties together.

3. Educate yourself: Learn about addiction and recovery so that you can better understand what your boyfriend is going through. This knowledge can help you provide the right kind of support, while also managing your own feelings and expectations.

4. Encourage self-care: Remind your boyfriend of the importance of self-care and stress reduction. Encourage him to continue with any therapy, support groups, or activities that aid in his recovery. By prioritizing his well-being, he may become more present and engaged in the relationship over time.

5. Seek professional help: If the distance and issues persist, it could be beneficial to involve a therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance and support for both of

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Relationships are hard work and most do not continue on the same path they started. They change over time because you change over time and changes can be hard with any relationship. However, there seems to be something bigger going on. I dont know the severity of his addiction, if he used drugs or was addicted to drugs while you were in a relationship and not in his life and both of your ages. There are a lot of factors to consider. However, the biggest message I would take from this is to be patient, compassionate and to think about how his actions are impacting you. If there is something he requires, he needs to let you know especially if you are making an effort. To continue to work through the addiction or stay open to relapsing, both of you must remain open-minded and create a winning atmosphere for both of you. If you love him, I am sure you understand what that looks like and if can address both of your concerns and needs much more simply.

Question: 
Ever since I was little, I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them. I treated everyone nice. For girls I liked, I would spend every second with them. It always ends the same way: “I like you as a friend,” or “I love your attention but not you.”
REAL ANSWER: 
Attention is often something that is both wanted and sometimes not wanted all the time. Maybe when you're in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with and/or what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I can understand how frustrating and disheartening it must be to consistently experience these situations. It can be difficult when we invest our time and emotions into someone, only to find that they do not reciprocate our feelings in the same way. While rejection is undoubtedly painful, it is important to remember that it does not define your worth or your ability to find love.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that attraction and compatibility are complex and individual preferences can differ greatly. It may not be a reflection on who you are as a person, but rather a matter of personal preference. It's essential to respect the other person's feelings and choices, even if they are not what you had hoped for.

Instead of internalizing the rejections and feeling discouraged, I would encourage you to focus on self-growth and understanding. Take this opportunity to work on developing your self-confidence and self-worth independent of romantic relationships. Understand that love and relationships require mutual feelings and effort from both sides.

It can also be helpful to broaden your social circle and engage in activities where you can meet new people who share similar interests and values. Building connections and friendships can help in finding someone who appreciates you for who you are.

Remember, finding a loving and fulfilling relationship takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself and the process. Keep an open mind and continue to be true to yourself. Ultimately, the right person who appreciates and reciprocates your feelings will come into your life when the

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Would you benefit from having a relationship?If the honesty hosts that you have a pattern of showing the girlfriend more attention than may be considerate, or accompanying interest in who the girl is and willingness to learn about her as a complete being, then consider these actions.After all, in a good relationship or any relationship, each partner is a unique and whole being in themselves. Consider that spending all your time being nice to a girl, or being nice to a girl in order to get her as a girlfriend, may or may not interest her. If she senses that you don't interest in what she offers as a human being, and whether you becoming frustrated that she doesn't get the 'hint', then she won't be interested in being your girlfriend.Sometimes people who often become frustrated at not being able to complete a task as they've set their mind to, turn to talking themselves out of interest in the task or the purpose. One the surface this looks like a good problem solving strategy. Yet what often happens is that the person has isolated an aspect of themselves, such as not caring about knowing another person as a whole person, and uses this as proof that since they can identify this aspect, the severs the ability to offer a different behavior, in this case to get to know people before pushing for them to accept as.them as a partner.

I have several issues like I don't like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years. When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying. I just stay away from people to avoid this. I look at people and think how I could hurt them. I feel like I am worthless and would be better off not in this world where I don't fit in. Every day I wake up it's like another day. Any info would be good.
REAL ANSWER: 
Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain. I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically. Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist. Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms. After getting these evaluations, your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing. Whether treatment includes medication and/or psychotherapist would be discussed. Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I can't provide the help that you need. It's important to talk to a mental health professional about what you're experiencing. They can offer you the support and guidance that you need to cope with these thoughts and feelings.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
It sounds like you are carrying around a lot of heavy thoughts and emotions. Don't try to carry these feelings around by yourself- find someone who you can relate to and talk to them. Often you can find a trusted friend, or family member, who will lend an ear and listen to whatever you need to share. If you don't feel they will be accepting or supportive then try to connect with a local counselor who you can see. We have several outpatient clinics in each city, a local mental health center and we even have quite a few telehealth clinics that have opened up because of COVID. You can even see if there is any clinic in your area that has sliding scale fees, which basically means they will work with you and you will only pay what you can.

Question: 
I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him.    Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves.    He knows that I still crush on him. He doesn't rub it in my face. He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous.
REAL ANSWER: 
First off, I think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship, despite the fact that you have feelings for him. I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. Know that you won't be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings, and understanding. Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....I'm not sure if that is possible. If you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what. Be careful that you take care of yourself and don't jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues. Good luck to you!

Raw GPT Answer: 
It sounds like you care a lot about your male best friend, Tim, and want to support him through his current situation. It's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding for Tim's feelings.

First, when it comes to helping Tim with his current relationship with Sally, it's important to keep in mind that he is in a committed relationship with her. While you may have your own feelings, it's best to prioritize his happiness and well-being. Encourage him to communicate openly and honestly with Sally about his concerns for the future and how he is feeling. Help him explore potential ways to strengthen their relationship, such as finding shared interests or activities they can enjoy together during the time they have left.

When Sally eventually leaves for college, it's natural for Tim to feel sad and uncertain about the future. As his friend, you can support him by being there to listen and validate his feelings. Encourage him to express his emotions and concerns without judgment or offering quick fixes. Sometimes all someone needs is a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on. Remind Tim that it's normal to feel heartbroken after a breakup, but assure him that with time and support, he will be able to heal and love again.

In terms of your own feelings for Tim, it's important to prioritize and work on your own emotional well-being before considering a future relationship. Let him know that you care about him as a friend and you want to support him genuinely without any expectations or conditions. Show him

Hi Portsmouth,I really commend you for being so dedicated to your friend. It sound like he is a lucky guy to have you in his corner. There are many layers to your question, so I will respond to them in order. First, I want you to consider talking with Tim about the possibility that his relationship with Sally could end. Sometimes when relationships are new and awesome, we can get so wrapped up in them that it is really hard to see things outside of our relationship bubble. In some respectful way, you might say, "Oh Tim. You know I adore you, and I hope for the best for both of you. But these are your high school years, and who knows what will happen? There is a chance that you could break up down the road. it's just something to consider." That being said, as her friend, you might also try to help him think of good ways to support her if they do stay together. Sometimes we make things more complicated than they are. Simply expressing our love and care for someone, is usually enough of a gesture as long as it is heartfelt. You asked how to make Tim feel better. I think just being there and listening to him is a good start. You don't have to have all the answers and you don't have to focus so hard on taking his pain away. Sometimes when we try to stop another person from having their own experience, we get in the way of them processing their real feelings. With that in mind,

What a wonderful question!Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now, I'd ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If, for example, you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships, then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self, even when this sets you apart from your friends.If, you feel you need a man to protect you financially, then possibly you've lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If you'd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately, then you've found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than "need".

Raw GPT Answer: 
It's understandable that you may have questions about your attraction to older men. Attraction is a complex and personal experience, and there can be multiple factors that contribute to it. It's important to remember that people are attracted to others for various reasons, and there is no right or wrong in terms of who you're attracted to.

Some individuals may find themselves attracted to older partners due to qualities like wisdom, life experience, stability, or maturity that they perceive in them. Others might feel a connection with someone older due to shared interests or values. Personal experiences, family dynamics, and cultural influences can also shape our attractions.

It could be helpful to explore your feelings and motivations around this attraction. Reflecting on your past experiences and relationships might offer some insight into why you feel drawn to older men. Additionally, it can be valuable to discuss this with a therapist or counselor who can provide support and help you navigate your feelings in a safe and nonjudgmental space.

Remember, understanding your attractions is a journey of self-discovery, and it's okay to seek guidance as you explore these feelings further.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling alone, sad, and frustrated in your relationships. It's clear that you have a caring and compassionate nature, and it's commendable that you want to help others. However, it's important to also prioritize your own well-being and happiness in relationships. Here are a few suggestions to help you break this pattern:

1. Self-reflection: Take some time to reflect on your past relationships and analyze what attracted you to these men in difficult situations. Consider whether you have a pattern of feeling the need to rescue or fix others. Understanding your own motivations can help you make conscious choices in the future.

2. Set healthy boundaries: It's crucial to establish clear boundaries in relationships, especially when someone is struggling. Recognize that you can't singlehandedly solve someone else's problems. By setting limits and communicating your needs, you can create a healthier dynamic that allows both partners to take responsibility for their own growth.

3. Focus on compatibility: When entering a new relationship, try to prioritize compatibility in values, goals, and overall emotional health. Building a strong foundation based on shared interests, trust, and mutual support can increase the chances of a healthier and more balanced partnership.

4. Seek support: Consider reaching out for support from friends, family, or even a therapist. Talking about your experiences and feelings with a neutral person can provide valuable insights and help you navigate your way forward.

5. Work on self-care: Taking care of your own needs

Question: 
I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?
REAL ANSWER: 
Hey, dogs are cool. They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them. Your girlfriend on the other hand, likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours. You are good with dogs, that tells me that you've spent some time observing their behavior. The first step in working through this issue would be similar, start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building. The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching. And keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It's okay to have a strong bond with your pets, but it's also important to maintain healthy relationships with the people in your life. I can understand that struggling with dog obsession disorder can make it challenging to prioritize your girlfriend over your dogs.

Firstly, I encourage you to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your struggles and feelings. Explain to her that you recognize the issue and that you want to work on it together. Sharing your vulnerabilities can help build trust and understanding between you both.

Consider seeking professional help from a therapist who specializes in obsessive-compulsive disorders or animal-related issues. They can provide you with specific strategies and support tailored to your situation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) might be particularly beneficial in helping you manage your thoughts and behaviors related to the disorder.

In addition to therapy, try creating a schedule that includes designated quality time for your girlfriend. This can be in the form of date nights, outings, or shared activities that you both enjoy. By making a conscious effort to spend quality time together, you can strengthen your bond and show your girlfriend that she is a priority in your life.

Remember that finding balance is key. It's important to give attention and care to both your girlfriend and your dogs. Develop daily routines that incorporate spending time with your dogs without neglecting your girlfriend's needs. Open communication and compromise are essential in maintaining a healthy and loving relationship.

Lastly, be patient with yourself as change takes time and effort. Celebrate small victories and

Question: 
How do I cope with losing my mom?
REAL ANSWER: 
First, I want to say how sorry I am for your loss. The grief of losing a parent can be very difficult to work through. When you lose someone you love, you are forever changed. The goal of working through any loss is to reach a "new normal." Though you will never forget your mom, the grief processing is about learning to live in a different way, without her physical presence. One of the best things you can do is find a good support system. You need to talk about your loss, and talk about it a lot. Talking helps work through your emotions and reach a place of healing. Find friends you trust who can support you or find a good grief support group. They are hugely beneficial since the group will understand exactly how you feel. If you find you are still struggling, a good grief counselor will also help.

I'm really sorry to hear about the loss of your mom. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and it's normal to feel a range of emotions during this time. Coping with such a profound loss is a unique and personal journey, but here are a few things that may be helpful:

1. Allow yourself to grieve: It's important to give yourself permission to experience the grief and all the emotions that come with it. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and it's okay to feel sad, angry, or even numb. Take the time you need to mourn and honor your mom's memory.

2. Seek support: Surround yourself with loved ones who can offer support. Share your thoughts and emotions, and allow others to comfort you during this challenging time. If needed, consider joining a support group or seeking professional help to guide you through the grieving process.

3. Take care of yourself: While grieving, it's crucial to prioritize self-care. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and peace, such as practicing mindfulness, exercising, journaling, or engaging in hobbies that you enjoy. Be gentle with yourself and give yourself permission to take breaks when you need them.

4. Preserve memories: Cherish the memories you have of your mom. Look through old photos, write down stories, or create a special space in your home where you can honor her memory. These tangible reminders can provide comfort and make you feel closer to her.

5. Accept your emotions

Question: 
In the state of New York, is it legal for someone to record a counseling session without telling the counselor or the other person in the session?
REAL ANSWER: 
In New York (like most states), the law generally is what's called a "one-party consent" rule. This means that in most cases it is legal to record a conversation as long as consent has been granted by at least one person involved in the conversation.It probably would not be illegal for a client to secretly record a counseling session without the consent of the counselor. Since only one person's consent is required, it would be sufficient that the client consented.On the other hand, it would probably be illegal for a third party to record a counseling session without the consent of the counselor or the client.Similarly, it would be a violation of ethical standards (and maybe a violation of law) for a counselor to secretly record a session without the client's consent.
....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raw GPT Answer: 
It's essential to emphasize that I'm not a lawyer, but I can provide you with some general information on the subject. In New York, as of my knowledge, it is a one-party consent state when it comes to recording conversations. This means that as long as one person participating in the conversation gives their consent to be recorded, it is generally legal to do so. However, it's important to consider the ethical implications of recording a counseling session without informing the counselor or obtaining their consent. Open communication and trust are vital components of a therapeutic relationship, and recording without consent may affect those dynamics. If you have concerns about recording sessions, it's best to discuss them openly and honestly with your counselor to find a resolution that respects everyone's rights and boundaries. Additionally, seeking legal advice or consulting credible sources in your area can provide more accurate and up-to-date information regarding local laws.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
The simple answer is yes. The slightly longer answer is, the courts pay very careful attention to client consent in essentially all areas and formats of treatment. The issue with therapy is that a recording of a session can be seen as a statement of someone's state of mind at a particular time, something which is protected. Standing in a grey area is recording a session with the intention of getting a second opinion, particularly when it's done in good faith for the benefit of the client.Many providers, like myself, request written or oral consent for their session to be recorded, signed releases, and the like. You are absolutely likely to find therapists who insist on all manner of these things related to their privacy, and these are all legal and ethical safeguards. Personally, I think if I saw someone recording our session and asked why they did so, and their explanation was adequate, I personally think I could accommodate that request (but I don't plan to find out one way or the other if I'm ever proven wrong here!). However, not all therapists will feel this way, and it's ultimately an individual therapist call in many cases as to whether to treat when they know pertinent information will remain off the record. That is likely at the crux of the issue - a recording that a therapist is unaware of or believing to be part of a confidential process is ultimately not a trustworthy process. It's not that a process can't be ethical and confidential, only that it immediately raises questions about whether it is that lower

Question: 
Is it wrong that I'm married and I have a best friend that's like a sister to me?
REAL ANSWER: 
Although we all want (or wish) that our partner is also our best friend, in reality this doesn't always happen. There may be issues, of course and there are many things to consider there, such as "why do we need" another person to confide in, or are we actually attracted to this "best friend" but because we know we can't have them we put this thought behind etc. etc. Is this friend and old friend, an old flame or a new acquired friend; the latter is complicated and probably the most questionable, in my view. So, many things to think about and there is no one answer fits all.

Raw GPT Answer: 
No, it is not wrong to have a close friend who is like a sister to you, even if you are married. Friendships outside of marriage are normal and can be beneficial for our overall well-being. The key in any relationship, including friendships, is to have open communication with your spouse and maintain appropriate boundaries. As long as you are being honest, maintaining trust, and giving equal attention and care to your spouse, there should be no issue with having a best friend. It's important to remember that different relationships serve different purposes in our lives, and having diverse sources of emotional support can be enriching for everyone involved.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Simply said: no. For one thing, we often marry our best friend. But I assume you mean a woman who is not your wife. Marital and family therapists really emphasize the importance of cleared, well-defined boundaries so that roles do not become blurred - and confusing - in our relationships. This needs special attention in male/female relationships due to the risk of emotional crossovers that can jeopardize marriage. But it is possible to have a bestie of the opposite sex when married; restrictions are possible and may be necessary under some circumstances. But yes, true intimacy within marriage should parallel normal intimacy between friends, so you may want to ask yourself whether perhaps your marriage has some other needs for attention.

Question: 
I'm in a lesbian relationship, and my mother doesn't really approve.
REAL ANSWER: 
It can be very difficult, when our parents do not approve of significant aspects of who we are. As children, we need our parents approval, and as adults, we often still desire it. Some things I am wondering about are, how do you feel about your sexuality and your relationship with your mother? Is there anything you would like to have different in your relationship with your mother? I don't know if these questions resonate with you or not, but if there are some conflicted feelings in regards to your mother, working with a competent therapist may be a good way of getting clarity about how you would like to move forward.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm here to listen and support you. It can be really difficult when our loved ones don't approve of our relationships. It's important to remember that their reaction is a reflection of their beliefs and experiences, and not a reflection of your worthiness or the validity of your relationship. That being said, finding ways to navigate this situation can be challenging. 

Have you had a conversation with your mother about her disapproval? It might be helpful to find a time when you both can talk openly and calmly about your feelings and concerns. Try to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging her perspective while also expressing your own. Remember, you can't change someone's beliefs or opinions overnight, but open dialogue may help to foster understanding and open up the possibility of acceptance over time.

If having a conversation feels too difficult or doesn't yield positive results, it's important to prioritize your wellbeing and mental health. Surrounding yourself with a supportive community can help you find validation, acceptance, and understanding outside of your family. Seek out LGBTQ+ support groups, online communities, or even counseling to connect with people who share similar experiences and can offer guidance and support.

Remember, you deserve love and happiness, regardless of other people's disapproval. Keep being true to yourself and finding ways to foster a sense of belonging and acceptance in your life.

First of all, sorry to hear about this dificult time you are going through. For now, I would probably question what it is exactly the types of behaviors that you are seeing from your parents that are not only mean to you, but mean to the fact that you are in a meaningful relationship with someone. You may ask her some of the following questions: Do you see me in this relationship? Why is it so important that I get a guy versus a girl? How does my sexual orientation affect your life in any way shape or form? What do you fear may happen when it becomes public to other people in our family or close friends? She may not be too excited to answer any of those questions and she may just get more defensive. We have to defrost the many negative perception of relationships by letting others know that you are in fact in an intimate relationship with someone. Everyone in the world has that right to until it becomes unhealthy and problematic. Find your voice and let it be known that it upsets you that she is not allowing for you to have conversations with her that make her unhappy, especially when it is about you and how you choose to live your life. I don't see any other pathway except to set in stone the boundaries based on the qualifications for any and every relationship. Stick to your guns, as I am sure you have with everything else in your life. :), DBH, LPC, NCCWilmingon, North Carolina

Question: 
I have been repeating the same thought pattern for seven years and have completely lost control of any situation. I am in my early 30s, and I feel like I am trapped in my body, mind, soul, and house because I feel embarrassed to go anywhere or talk to anyone.
REAL ANSWER: 
There's SO much help for repetitive thoughts in the counseling world! The one thing I'd for sure ask if we met in person is what those repetitive thought patterns look like. Some repetitive thoughts are more like obsessive thoughts. For example, that may mean that every time you leave a room, your obsessive thought is to switch the light on and off 5 times. Or every time you touch a door handle, you think about the germs you came into contact with and washing your hands multiple times. Sometimes it's more about the same thoughts repeating about bad things that may happen, or critical thoughts we have about ourselves. Your statement about "feeling confident again" gives me the sense that maybe you struggle with the ways in which you think about yourself.Assuming it's obsessive thoughts: exposure and response prevention therapy is an excellent form of treatment. Typically, obsessive thoughts influence compulsions, which usually show up as very strict, repetitive rituals in order to manage anxiety. Exposure and response prevention exposes you to the things that increase anxiety, while response prevention helps you to sit through that anxiety response without performing a compulsion. For example, you touch a door handle. Your anxiety increases. You obsess about the germs you came into contact with and have a strong urge to wash your hands multiple times. Instead, you sit through the anxiety, let the anxiety decrease on its own, and slowly unpair that anxious response with the behavior. The more you do this, the more it breaks up those thinking/behavior patterns that make you feel chained to them.Assuming it's self-critical thoughts: cognitive-behavioral therapy can work well here. Everyone's brain has a default track, that when met with struggle, plays over and over like a broken record. The more you give into that, the more it plays. The trick here is creating a competing track, or turning the volume up on a track that boosts your confidence instead of shooting it down. Some ways to do that are really identifying and writing down what those repetitive thoughts are. You probably already know them pretty well if they repeat often. Then next to them--write out a line that has an heir of confidence and/or gentleness. For example, if your repetitive thought is that you are a failure, you may write out a sentence that is something like: I may be struggling greatly with this situation, yet I am still trying super hard to get better and that's definitely not a failure. Every separate repetitive thought can have its own competing sentence. Initially, these new thoughts will feel weird, foreign, and maybe even like they don't do anything. Give it time. The repetitive thoughts have had years to grow, so these new thoughts need time, too. They are, literally, new pathways in the brain and the more they are traveled, the stronger they will get.I'm also sensing that there's a combination of anxiety and depression. I would assume that you are probably feeling pretty cut off from the world if you don't want to talk to anyone. That can be so lonely and isolating. Because connection is basically crucial for healing, it may be very beneficial for you to see a counselor or find a support that feels safe to you. Counselors are usually trained very well in these types of issues and some offer telehealth if you are having trouble leaving your home. It might feel scary and strange at first, but you are in a lot of pain and deserve healing.Hope this helps a bit. Go with your gut and do what you feel is right for you! I wish you all the best.

Question: 
After receiving counseling, we have been told my husband has a black and white personality disorder. When I offer compromises in our disagreements, he does not seem to understand. We cannot resolve conflict because he only sees things as black or white. My husband has asked that we go to counseling this time. In the past, it has been my suggestion. We are thinking of going to a marriage mediator this time because there are financial issues that need to be resolved. He cannot see the whole picture when I attempt to explain my side to him.
REAL ANSWER: 
I never heard of a marriage mediator before.Since you already went to counseling and the therapist observed your husband's tendency to see black and white in life, and because counseling functions on a deeper level than a mediator generally does, a marriage mediator sounds like a step backwards.Why not go to a financial mediator?This would satisfy your husband's black white outlook and may satisfy you too because no emotions are expected in financial discussion and the relationship suffers from an expectations surrounding emotion.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It's great to hear that you and your husband have recognized the need for counseling and are considering the option of a marriage mediator. It can be challenging when one person has a black and white thinking pattern, as it can hinder effective communication and problem-solving within a relationship.

In the context of your financial issues, a marriage mediator may be helpful in facilitating a neutral and unbiased environment where both of you can express your perspectives and work towards finding compromises. Mediators are trained to help couples see and understand multiple perspectives and guide them towards finding mutually beneficial solutions.

When approaching your husband with your concerns, I suggest emphasizing the benefits of going to a marriage mediator and how it can help you both make progress in resolving conflicts. Highlight the fact that the mediator will provide a safe space for both of you to express your thoughts and concerns without judgment.

It's essential to communicate with empathy, understanding, and patience. Remember that change takes time, and your husband's black and white thinking pattern might not change overnight. Encourage him to be open-minded and willing to consider different viewpoints during the mediation process. 

Lastly, keep in mind that seeking professional help is a positive step towards improving your relationship. Sometimes, having an objective third party can provide new insights and bring about positive changes. I wish you both the best of luck on your journey towards resolving conflicts and finding common ground.

Raw GPT Answer: 
I'm here to listen and support you through this difficult time. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of worry and frustration about not being able to find someone you care about who is isolated. It's important to acknowledge that it can be challenging when we can't directly help someone we care about. It must be difficult for you not knowing where this person is and wanting to assist them.

It might be helpful to explore some coping strategies that can help you navigate this situation. Firstly, prioritize taking care of yourself emotionally and physically. Reach out to friends, family, or a counselor like me for support during this time. It's essential to have a support system in place.

In terms of finding the person you're concerned about, consider reaching out to mutual friends or acquaintances who may have some information about their whereabouts. You can also explore some online resources or platforms where you might be able to connect with them indirectly. But remember, always respect their need for privacy, and if they don't want to be found, it's important to honor their wishes.

Finally, it might be helpful to remind yourself that, ultimately, we can't control others' actions or choices. While it's natural to want to help someone we care about, it's also important to acknowledge that people have their own agency and may not want or be ready for our assistance. Try to find peace within yourself by knowing that you have done what you can and that sometimes, all we can do is be there when they choose

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
I'm so very sorry for your loss. It sounds like it must be very difficult for you to loose someone and also have others that you care about be so affected by it. When someone close to us dies, many people may wind up taking on the supportive person role and have trouble finding someone to express their own grief to. Find others who were close to the person who died as well or just find someone who may be able to be supportive to you. Ask them if they have a few minutes so you can talk about a few thoughts and feelings and that you would really just like them to listen and to tell you they're sorry this has been so hard for you. It will feel good on some level to be heard and known by them and soothed and become a part of a healing context.

Question: 
I met the first man five months ago. I have come a long way and do have feelings for him. I know he would do anything for me and my kids. The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him. I know they both love me, and I love both of them.
REAL ANSWER: 
The answer depends entirely on which interest is stronger for you.If the reliable caretaker man is not someone with whom you'd have fun, lively conversations, understand each other, be sexually compatible, or romantically attracted, and your primary interest is in someone who' steadily manage the kids, household, and finances, then he is the right one for you!The problem is you may not be happy longterm with someone to whom you feel no romantic compatibility. Consider the drawback if you reach the moment of restlessness romantically and are with someone on whom you depend to take care of your kids.Since you have feelings for him, then wait several months longer to see whether or not you can imagine yourself romantically happy with the steady guy.If the other guy who is also the bio dad, isn't involved with his own kids, then he seems like a poor choice of someone to be with longterm.

Raw GPT Answer: 
It sounds like you have a lot of love in your life, but it also seems like you might be torn between two men: the first man you met five months ago and the father of your children. It can be incredibly challenging when our hearts are divided between two people we love, and there's no easy solution or one-size-fits-all answer. It's important to take some time to reflect on what truly matters to you and what you envision for your future.

Consider asking yourself some questions: What are the qualities you value most in a partner? What kind of relationship do you want for yourself and your children in the long run? Are there any unresolved issues or challenges in your relationship with the father of your children that need to be addressed? Can those issues be resolved through open and honest communication? 

Ultimately, the decision is yours to make, but it may help to have open and honest conversations with both men involved. Express your feelings and concerns, as well as the love you have for each of them. It is important to explore their perspectives as well.

It's also worth mentioning that seeking guidance from a professional counselor or therapist could provide you with more personalized support as you navigate this challenging decision-making process. They can help you gain insight into your emotions, understand your needs, and guide you in finding the best path forward.

Fine-Tuned Answer: 
Thank you! First, It is so wonderful to that you have taken the time to talk to your boyfriend and husband about your feelings. Open, honest communication can go a long way in a relationship. I definitely understand why you would consider yourself torn, because you talk about how you love one of them as a father figure and the other as your AMDB partner.If I was sitting with you in therapy, I would have a couple of questions for you to think on and then would ask a bit more about your history and feelings:What stops you from loving your current partner as a romantic partner the way that you love him as a "father figure"? Are you in love with both men or only your husband? What will happen when/if your husband (either on his own or as asked by you) finds found someone? Is this issue strictly temporary sort? In other words, do you see yourself moving back to your children's home city at some point in the near future?Answering these questions may help you to form a better idea of where your feelings are coming from. Regardless of why you aren't able to love the father of your children the way you would like, giving one's self permission for who someone is, not for who they aren't, may be just what you need to move on...or at least to figure out what you are needing. :)Consider where your feelings come from (for example fear or anxiety) and whether or not they are helping you get what you are needing
