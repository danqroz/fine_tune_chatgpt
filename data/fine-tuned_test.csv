"After receiving counseling, we have been told my husband has a black and white personality disorder. When I offer compromises in our disagreements, he does not seem to understand. We cannot resolve conflict because he only sees things as black or white. My husband has asked that we go to counseling this time. In the past, it has been my suggestion. We are thinking of going to a marriage mediator this time because there are financial issues that need to be resolved. He cannot see the whole picture when I attempt to explain my side to him.","If the only issue is the one you describe, I am not sure that black and white thinking alone is a complex enough way to describe it. There are different kinds of thinking that contributes to difficulty resolving conflict. That being said, and as Jenny stated above, I think it is a great time for you to receiving couples counseling because of the improvements in communication that would occur. Consider seeking out a therapist that is Certified in the Gottman Method as research supports the efficacy of this approach. If would assist with helping each other understanding each others perspectives as well as black and white thinking. All of the therapists in our office are Certified in the Gottman Method."
"Ever since I was little, I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them. I treated everyone nice. For girls I liked, I would spend every second with them. It always ends the same way: “I like you as a friend,” or “I love your attention but not you.”","Would you benefit from having a relationship?If the honesty hosts that you have a pattern of showing the girlfriend more attention than may be considerate, or accompanying interest in who the girl is and willingness to learn about her as a complete being, then consider these actions.After all, in a good relationship or any relationship, each partner is a unique and whole being in themselves. Consider that spending all your time being nice to a girl, or being nice to a girl in order to get her as a girlfriend, may or may not interest her. If she senses that you don't interest in what she offers as a human being, and whether you becoming frustrated that she doesn't get the 'hint', then she won't be interested in being your girlfriend.Sometimes people who often become frustrated at not being able to complete a task as they've set their mind to, turn to talking themselves out of interest in the task or the purpose. One the surface this looks like a good problem solving strategy. Yet what often happens is that the person has isolated an aspect of themselves, such as not caring about knowing another person as a whole person, and uses this as proof that since they can identify this aspect, the severs the ability to offer a different behavior, in this case to get to know people before pushing for them to accept as.them as a partner."
"He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.","Trust and intimacy are closely related and go hand in hand. Trust is a building block of a healthy relationship. Your current doubts may be due to your lack of trust. If your boyfriend is now being honest about different areas of his life and changing for the better then I’d say you have improvement to work on from the past, him having lied to you, but I’m not hearing any current reason for mistrust. It may be you would be better off working with a relationship coach, or even going to couples counseling to help you both move forward toward a trusting relationship. Also, trust is always earned, so he is building trust back each and every day and month he is working to be honest with you. Earning back trust won’t happen overnight."
How do I cope with losing my mom?,"The loss of a parent is so tough. If you get the time to talk to my mom or see her before she passes, be real honest with her and tell her you'll miss you, that you'll be okay, and that you love her. These are only some of the things I wish I could have. It's okay to grieve and miss her. Think of her often, remember her fondly, and be grateful for the time that you do have with her."

I always feel like I'm not good enough and it literally is so hard living. I don't know how to talk to my parents about it.,"Ask yourself by behaving as if ""I am good enough"".Experimental action is the most powerful learning tool you've got!Also, thinking of something you do that you recognize is good, and attaching the thought of, ""I do well with this, that means I'm good enough in..."".Little by little, try each day to do something which makes you feel, ""I'm ok as a person!""You can alter the way you feel. Parents are likely to tell you their version of what they feel about you.There's the chance that you're not very similar to their style.A valid reason to go with your own appraisal of yourself."
"I am a teenager. I have been experiencing major episodes of depression (if that's even what it is) for several years. It’s always getting worse. I have been having panic attacks, feeling like I can't control my fears, and I can't even bring myself to care if I live or die anymore. The problem is that I don't know who to ask for help. When I try to talk to my parents, I freeze completely and can't do anything but make a joke because never once in my life have we talked about our feelings.","Am I correct that your thoughts and feelings have been repressed so that it disturbs you from self-expression?If this is what you believe, then no matter who you do or do not speak with,be sure to assure yourself that who you are and what you feel is fine, even if you cannot talk about your feelings. Since you've been able to talk about not being able to talk, all of you will get to being able to talk.Difficulties often take longer to reverse than for the problem creating the painful symptoms to start.Be gentle with your impatience!"
"I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him.
   The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. In my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.","How fortunate you have two little girls in your life.First, it would be a kind thought for you to become willing to accept and tolerate tension and confusion in your life when your ex, your current husband, and all the children are part of one another's lives. Even the best of plans can go awry.With this as your attitude, you may be less likely to expect whatever stressors become part of your interactions to go away immediately.Next is there any way you can talk with these two other adults to make a plan of who will do what and when?This plan will save you from details of picking up and dropping of the girls which don't pertain to you. Also, it may lessen the awkwardness your other two partners may feel when dealing with one another. What may be an unexpected glitch is that by specifying who does what with the girls, your ex and partner may be less willing to alter this approach, even when circumstances warrant it. To give up ""doing your own thing"" in some areas may be the hardest to do for most people. Twice a year, my alma mater has a big college basketball game on campus. It took me at least two years to coordinate this event with some other friends, each of us agreed as to what our specific responsibilities would be, and each year we have to tweak it a little bit more.

"I am going through a divorce. He is extremely angry. He refuses to physically assist me with our teenager daughter. I have no extended family support. Often times, I feel overwhelmed, tired, and joyless. I feel out of control, sad and depressed on a daily basis. I am just going through the motions of life every day. I am in my mid-50s. I have almost 29 years on my job. How can I handle this?",Sounds very stressful and difficult. Glad you are reaching out during a difficult time.  based on your description you have depression. I would find a support that involves at least weekly therapy and consider psychiatric evaluation. The fact that you recognize these problems is a good sign that you are motivated to make change.
"I crave attention, companionship, and sex. She has had a hysterectomy, and she has a bad knee.","It sounds like you're trying to find a different focus for your energy while your wife recovers from these things - is that correct? Sex isn't the primary focus in a relationship, and sometimes this is easy to forget or to set that aside when there has been an injury or medical issue. The first thing women often need when they're recovering from something is the chance to feel that their partners empathize with the issues (can you show her that you understand her pain or what she's going through?). Sometimes, simply offering hands on (non-sexual) nurturing and care is enough for a time while the other person feels unwell or in pain. If this is something you can offer, it can be a really good way to ""connect"" for a bit even in the absence of sex. If you were to offer a 10 or 15 minute foot massage, for example, you get to have physical contact and attention on her and you get to ""be there"" for her in the ways that you want without making any extra demands such as she focus on your attention rather than the pain she's facing right now. Often, sex is something offered and received within the context of love and caregiving, so this can be a good way to stay connected overall.If you genuinely have needs for attention and companionship that go beyond that, then it may be healthy to let her know what those are. Perhaps while you make dinner, she can sit with you and you can catch up with each"
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,Hello there. I am glad you are able to recognize when you are becoming angry. That is a step in the right direction. I also think it may be useful to practice spending some time within a session to see if you recognize the beginning of the event. And that is knowing yourself and being in touch with yourself if you have a specific definition of what that looks like when it is beginning.To be in touch with what the feeling of anger feels like in your body so you have an idea of what's happening before a blow up occurs. That you practice angry and in and blow by blow fashion so you have choices available to you before you actually go to the circumstance. What I really enjoy this having on your side is some way to remove energy or the physical signals through your body so that when you do become around you have a way to get grounded or get centered so you know what the first action step you can take that you have rehearsed in advance. Practicing patience in advance. practice grounding exercises. Also for this app talk space if you need bigger strategies on how to deal with the people who are on the other side of what that interaction looks like.
"I feel like I'm ugly, stupid, useless, and that I can't make anyone happy.","You are asking the right person. My journey to helping others started with was I was just a little younger than you are. It took strength to post this on here and ask for help. I know I am just words from a stranger but I am smiling with excitement for you right now. I don't help you; I show you how you can help yourself. Be willing to know pain, and deal with you. Every single thing you do starts with the decision to do it. The person who you see in the mirror...you decide, every day, what that looks like to you. Just like you've made up your mind on what you look like...you can restructure that as well. He doesn't have my resume or know my skill set, I wouldn't let that bother you too much. Be you, and be you for you...the rest will tumble after that. I am not asking you to be fearless; I am asking you to trust yourself. It's worth it, I promise."
I have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. I really want to stop it and enjoy things.,"You are expressing one of the major issues of being human: recognition and acceptance from others. All of us crave and seek it in ways both conscious and unconscious. In fact, you could say that it is in order to keep us all ""in check"". If you hurt or destroy others then the rest of us will probably kick you out of the group.Then, there is some of us that focus so much on this that it tends to run our lives. Is this you? Do you define ""enjoying things"" as others saying ""I like how Jane is having fun"". Normal? Yes. Enjoyable? Not from the sound of it. Bad habit? If it gets in the way of you doing other things, then, Yes. If you are stuck and need some help, find yourself a logical-minded psychotherapist and work your way out of it. It is VERY hard to measure yourself by how YOU think of you and NOT care about what others think. It is also VERY rewarding!"
I have been dating my ex-boyfriend’s cousin for a few years. We have gotten pretty serious. He wants to cut it off because people are giving him a hard time that our kids will be related to my ex.,"Sadly, there may never be complete acceptance of your relationship. But as long as you and your boyfriend are good mates, this is what you focus on.People have their opinions and you have your choice as to who you date and the matters of your personal life.
Ask yourself if the people in your world add quality to your life or create unnecessary hassles. Depending on your answer, you may want to move on between many people who are open to you.Identify in the beginning, and keep this front and center in your mind, that whom you invite into your life is your privilege. You can decide to invite all the people you know, some or none. The choice is yours."
"I have been holding myself for nearly a month. I can not bear it. He is isolated from everybody, and I want to help, but I cannot find him.","I'm so very sorry for your loss. It sounds like it must be very difficult for you to loose someone and also have others that you care about be so affected by it. When someone close to us dies, many people may wind up taking on the supportive person role and have trouble finding someone to express their own grief to. Find others who were close to the person who died as well or just find someone who may be able to be supportive to you. Ask them if they have a few minutes so you can talk about a few thoughts and feelings and that you would really just like them to listen and to tell you they're sorry this has been so hard for you. It will feel good on some level to be heard and known by them and soothed and become a part of a healing context."
"I have been repeating the same thought pattern for seven years and have completely lost control of any situation. I am in my early 30s, and I feel like I am trapped in my body, mind, soul, and house because I feel embarrassed to go anywhere or talk to anyone.","I can sense the strength of your awareness of your situation and readiness to have a different set of circumstances.I am making an assumption that by your words, ""and talk to anyone"", you aren't including your home. Therefore, you have some sort of social interaction, even if by remote, with the outside world, from your computer, Smartphone, or however else you have online access.Perhaps for starters, you may consider knowing that definitions and limitations are according to how an individual perceives them.If you don't feel pleased by the present parameters of your life, then to what extent you'd like to adjust them becomes up to you.In other words, your age or state of not having control over your situation, are each your topic to change according to your values and desires."
I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her.

The dogs are clearly safe and care for- are you/have you done the same for your girlfriend? Its not a problem if you enjoy the company of your dogs more than your girlfriend.

I have several issues like I don't like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years. When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying. I just stay away from people to avoid this. I look at people and think how I could hurt them. I feel like I am worthless and would be better off not in this world where I don't fit in. Every day I wake up it's like another day. Any info would be good.,"It sounds like you are carrying around a lot of heavy thoughts and emotions. Don't try to carry these feelings around by yourself- find someone who you can relate to and talk to them. Often you can find a trusted friend, or family member, who will lend an ear and listen to whatever you need to share. If you don't feel they will be accepting or supportive then try to connect with a local counselor who you can see. We have several outpatient clinics in each city, a local mental health center and we even have quite a few telehealth clinics that have opened up because of COVID. You can even see if there is any clinic in your area that has sliding scale fees, which basically means they will work with you and you will only pay what you can."
"I have three children: a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. I'm scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.","If your three adult-aged children blame you for their drug addictions, then it makes me wonder if you were responsible for giving them the drugs and also for swallowing the pills or sticking the needle in themselves?It's highly likely that the discomfort the three of them feel and want to push out, has zero to do with you and everything to do with the guilt, shame, self-blame and probably wish to punish themselves for dying from drugs addiction.You are living your life.

"I met a guy a while ago, and I can't stop thinking about him. I feel like I love him, but I don't think I know him. What if he is not who I think he is?

But here it is! Only because_____. Only because what I hear in what you write, is: ""I love what this person brings out in me."" That's an amazing thing to love about someone, that they've touched you inside and brought out this new version of yourself.

"I met the first man five months ago. I have come a long way and do have feelings for him. I know he would do anything for me and my kids. The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him. I know they both love me, and I love both of them.","Thank you! First, It is so wonderful to that you have taken the time to talk to your boyfriend and husband about your feelings. Open, honest communication can go a long way in a relationship. I definitely understand why you would consider yourself torn, because you talk about how you love one of them as a father figure and the other as your AMDB partner.If I was sitting with you in therapy, I would have a couple of questions for you to think on and then would ask a bit more about your history and feelings:What stops you from loving your current partner as a romantic partner the way that you love him as a ""father figure""? Are you in love with both men or only your husband? What will happen when/if your husband (either on his own or as asked by you) finds found someone? Is this issue strictly temporary sort? In other words, do you see yourself moving back to your children's home city at some point in the near future?Answering these questions may help you to form a better idea of where your feelings are coming from. Regardless of why you aren't able to love the father of your children the way you would like, giving one's self permission for who someone is, not for who they aren't, may be just what you need to move on...or at least to figure out what you are needing. :)Consider where your feelings come from (for example fear or anxiety) and whether or not they are helping you get what you are needing"

We had a very good and friendly relationship, and we seemed to have a lot in common. I never gained the courage to ask her out.","Why not? What do you fear?Why didn't you want to date her when she was in the area?What do you love about life that you're using your mental energy to fantasize about someone you barely knew many years ago who lived too far from you to date?There is something about your current life you are actively hiding from your mind, that by spending the time you do on this girl you'll discover.Don't worry about being dead inside.

"I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him.    Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves.    He knows that I still crush on him. He doesn't rub it in my face. He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous.","Hi Portsmouth,I really commend you for being so dedicated to your friend. It sound like he is a lucky guy to have you in his corner. There are many layers to your question, so I will respond to them in order. First, I want you to consider talking with Tim about the possibility that his relationship with Sally could end. Sometimes when relationships are new and awesome, we can get so wrapped up in them that it is really hard to see things outside of our relationship bubble. In some respectful way, you might say, ""Oh Tim. You know I adore you, and I hope for the best for both of you. But these are your high school years, and who knows what will happen? There is a chance that you could break up down the road. it's just something to consider."" That being said, as her friend, you might also try to help him think of good ways to support her if they do stay together. Sometimes we make things more complicated than they are. Simply expressing our love and care for someone, is usually enough of a gesture as long as it is heartfelt. You asked how to make Tim feel better. I think just being there and listening to him is a good start. You don't have to have all the answers and you don't have to focus so hard on taking his pain away. Sometimes when we try to stop another person from having their own experience, we get in the way of them processing their real feelings. With that in mind,"
I'm feeling different towards my husband. I feel I am growing from the relationship. I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five. I just don't feel that connection anymore. I feel nothing. I don't know why or if I'm just being irrational.,"We hear you. Feeling as though you're falling out of love or growing apart is extremely painful. So is not being able to pinpoint why you feel the way you do. It's common to notice an ebb and flow in long-term relationships; just because you're not feeling very connected right doesn't necessarily mean things are doomed. It could be that other stressors are or have been consuming and/or distracting you right now and you haven't had a chance to connect much lately; give it some time. It's also possible the intimacy and connection you're craving doesn't need to come from your marriage alone, but from other relationships, too. Finally, it's conceivable this could be an early sign of marital drift. If you're willing and able, you might want to share how you're feeling with your husband so you're both on the same page. If there are other stressors happening right now (e.g., job change, health problems, death in the family, move, bad insomnia), those could be raising the intensity of your negative emotions and possibly magnifying the way you see your husband and your marriage. If these emotions persist or are getting stronger, you may want to talk with a couple's counselor to further explore your feelings and thoughts within the context of your marriage. They should be able to help you identify any patterns of thinking and behaving that might be exacerbating the issue and may have resources and suggestions for addressing them. Either way, it's important that you tend to"
"I'm in a lesbian relationship, and my mother doesn't really approve.","First of all, sorry to hear about this dificult time you are going through. For now, I would probably question what it is exactly the types of behaviors that you are seeing from your parents that are not only mean to you, but mean to the fact that you are in a meaningful relationship with someone. You may ask her some of the following questions: Do you see me in this relationship? Why is it so important that I get a guy versus a girl? How does my sexual orientation affect your life in any way shape or form? What do you fear may happen when it becomes public to other people in our family or close friends? She may not be too excited to answer any of those questions and she may just get more defensive. We have to defrost the many negative perception of relationships by letting others know that you are in fact in an intimate relationship with someone. Everyone in the world has that right to until it becomes unhealthy and problematic. Find your voice and let it be known that it upsets you that she is not allowing for you to have conversations with her that make her unhappy, especially when it is about you and how you choose to live your life. I don't see any other pathway except to set in stone the boundaries based on the qualifications for any and every relationship. Stick to your guns, as I am sure you have with everything else in your life. :), DBH, LPC, NCCWilmingon, North Carolina"
"I'm in my early 20s. I’ve been married once, and he cheated on me. Ever since then, I've felt ugly no matter what. I'm engaged, and I still feel ugly. I don't like to take pictures of myself.","Thank you for your question. A significant event, such your husband cheating, is enough to drastically affect someone’s self-esteem and self-worth. However, self-worth does not have to come from external factors like our appearance; it is an internal self-belief system. Self-worth has more to do with how we value, accept and approve of ourselves. Is that something that you struggle with? I would suggest that you focus on the things about yourself that you like and make a daily intention to remind yourself of these things. Having positive affirmations and post-it notes of  around your space is helpful so you have reminders. You can also work with a helping professional to challenge old, negative self-beliefs and develop new ones. Attached is also a worksheet on self-worth that might be useful.Finally, because you seem to link your worthiness to how you look physically, positive thinking alone may not be enough. Ask yourself where does this required/need for approval actually come from? Are you seeking the approval of others or even yourself? These are some other areas of exploration with your therapist. To challenge yourself to feel “worthy” in new ways, I also encourage you to do one thing in a week or month that takes the focus off your worthiness coming from your body or outside sources of validation and, instead works on feeling confident internally and connected to your body. Consider connecting with a therapist around exploring some of this. Also, have a clothes swap to celebrate the way that"
"I'm not suicidal and wouldn't take my own life, but sometimes, I've wished for an accident to occur and take it. I feel like I just shouldn't be here and wish I wouldn't have been born so I didn't have to go through life. For me, it's a chore, but I don't know if that's normal or a sign of something.","Feeling suicidal is never ""normal."" That doesn't mean, however, that you are ""crazy"" or ""broken."" A lot of people feel the way you do. When life is no fun and you can't imagine it will ever be, the idea of no longer existing can be tempting. What I'm wondering is why you wouldn't think of it as ""suicide"" if the death was accidental. A lot of us worry that the people around us would be better off if we were dead. I'm wondering if that's something that plays into your wish for an accident. Because the thing is that even with an accident, an unplanned death hurts people. And even though we don't know for sure what happens when we die, most people really hope that what comes after won't hurt them or others any more than they already hurt. People do care about you, even if sometimes you can't see it. If you're feeling very stuck, it might help to talk to a counselor. You can find someone in your area at ."
I'm unemployed just relocated. I can't get approved for a place to live because of past mistakes which follow me to this day. I'm depressed and on the verge of loosing my partner because I'm overwhelmed and have trouble functioning on a daily basis. I see no light at the end of this tunnel and need some help. I see no point in this chaos infested joke some call life.,"Tough time you are going through right now; feeling overwhelmed, can't seem to find the right job; can't let go of the past mistakes that seem to be haunting you. I am guessing if the past is still affecting you, the issues related haven't been reconciled yet. The opportunity to address those issues would be a great thing for you; to let go of them. So spend some time if you need to see a therapist to come to grips with the past, so you can then focus on the future. Be clear in your thinking of what it is you are good at, where you need to beef up your skills and what you like to do. If you want to work in a field that requires a certain level of education, consider going to school the job you don't want to do that you don't like. You say you're unemployed; if there is a job you can find that just brings in some income for the time-being, what happens then there's one less thing to worry about but you might cringe at the job that used to do which brings me to the idea of being open-minded. It's tough because life doesn't seem to be working out very well but consider a different perspective, so you can use this as a 'reset-button' which sometimes helps.Depression can affect the way that you think; the way that you think can contribute to or increase depression so if you aren't in therapy and you aren't on medication, see someone."
"I've been bulimic for about 6 years now. I'm in my early 20s. I am about to start back to school to become an RN, and I really need to get better once and for all.    I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?","Both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are highly effective in helping treat eating and body image issues. Make sure you find someone trained on using these approaches to eating disorders since they are not only found in specialists. Find a therapist with whom you can build a strong therapeutic alliance, willing to push you out of your comfort zone on the context of respect and understanding of your approach to your difficulties. Finally, seek help now and keep the therapists business card. Many providers are not able to accommodate changes in insurance status and have limited sliding fee schedule availabiliy in their offices, so once you have made the personal and financial commitment to start the journey to recovery, make sure you do not let a pesky logistic issue derail it."
"I've been feeling worthless, unaccomplished, and so frustrated. I want to break things, hit myself, run away, kick, scream, and cry. I just want to be happy and outgoing again. I want to be able to take care of my daughter and live comfortably.","No matter how your relationship with your mother was, it makes sense that your mother's death, pregnancy, or becoming a mother is bringing up a lot of emotions. There is no one way we are ""supposed"" to feel after someone we care about passes away or becoming a m o t h e r, but there are healthy ways to try to cope with your feelings. I can already tell that, even though you may not realize it, you love your daughter very much and you don't want these feeling to get in the way of being a good mom to her. A good mom with a good family doesn't mean that you never feel anger or sadness. It means, most importantly, that you have time and you are committed to these good things. I would recommend finding a therapist who feels like a good fit for you so you can start working on yourself (which is the work that we all need to do!). Hope that helps."
"I've pretty much been on my own since day one, I'm a middle child of five, and I can't seem to put my trust in anyone. It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend. Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again. I really want some help.","To develop a trust in others start with one person at a time. You say you opened up a little bit to your best friend, that's a start. As you realize that a person will receive your feelings you will be comfortable revealing more. Give yourself permission to show a little at a time and be patient with yourself in this process."
"In the state of New York, is it legal for someone to record a counseling session without telling the counselor or the other person in the session?","The simple answer is yes. The slightly longer answer is, the courts pay very careful attention to client consent in essentially all areas and formats of treatment. The issue with therapy is that a recording of a session can be seen as a statement of someone's state of mind at a particular time, something which is protected. Standing in a grey area is recording a session with the intention of getting a second opinion, particularly when it's done in good faith for the benefit of the client.Many providers, like myself, request written or oral consent for their session to be recorded, signed releases, and the like. You are absolutely likely to find therapists who insist on all manner of these things related to their privacy, and these are all legal and ethical safeguards. Personally, I think if I saw someone recording our session and asked why they did so, and their explanation was adequate, I personally think I could accommodate that request (but I don't plan to find out one way or the other if I'm ever proven wrong here!). However, not all therapists will feel this way, and it's ultimately an individual therapist call in many cases as to whether to treat when they know pertinent information will remain off the record. That is likely at the crux of the issue - a recording that a therapist is unaware of or believing to be part of a confidential process is ultimately not a trustworthy process. It's not that a process can't be ethical and confidential, only that it immediately raises questions about whether it is that lower"
Is it wrong that I'm married and I have a best friend that's like a sister to me?,"Simply said: no. For one thing, we often marry our best friend. But I assume you mean a woman who is not your wife. Marital and family therapists really emphasize the importance of cleared, well-defined boundaries so that roles do not become blurred - and confusing - in our relationships. This needs special attention in male/female relationships due to the risk of emotional crossovers that can jeopardize marriage. But it is possible to have a bestie of the opposite sex when married; restrictions are possible and may be necessary under some circumstances. But yes, true intimacy within marriage should parallel normal intimacy between friends, so you may want to ask yourself whether perhaps your marriage has some other needs for attention."
"Me and my adult daughter just do not get along. She's very belittling to me when I don't agree with her. It's almost like she scolds me. We get into all out war. She's said I don't support her in what she does and that I've never loved her. She calls me horrible names, and she pushes my buttons to the point I call her names.","The emotions that you are both experiencing during conflicts are intense. Shouting and name calling are not ways of getting your point across or receiving support in the way that you would like. If you and your daughter are willing to work on this together, you can absolutely improve your relationship by developing healthier forms of communication. It is crucial to be honest with one another and truly express how you feel. Each person may do this differently or may feel that the other is not listening to their thoughts and emotions. and creating common goals for your relationship do exist and this is a common area to focus on in therapy."
"My boyfriend and I recently broke up. One week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. He completely deleted me out of his life. He does have an opiate addiction. He claimed he was sober, but since we've split, I've heard many lies from him. Could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind?","Regina, There’s little we can do to figure out if your man is using again but I think you hit the nail on the head in your intuition that something is driving a wedge between you when you say: “does this addiction affect the mind?” Addiction affects the mind. They need to use and if that jeopardizes a relationship – well, sometimes that gets ignored. You need to focus on moving. I hope you can find some support to wade through the sadness – a good therapist would be great. Go. Fix. Yourself!"
My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction. We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant. I don't know what to do to fix the relationship.,"Relationships are hard work and most do not continue on the same path they started. They change over time because you change over time and changes can be hard with any relationship. However, there seems to be something bigger going on. I dont know the severity of his addiction, if he used drugs or was addicted to drugs while you were in a relationship and not in his life and both of your ages. There are a lot of factors to consider. However, the biggest message I would take from this is to be patient, compassionate and to think about how his actions are impacting you. If there is something he requires, he needs to let you know especially if you are making an effort. To continue to work through the addiction or stay open to relapsing, both of you must remain open-minded and create a winning atmosphere for both of you. If you love him, I am sure you understand what that looks like and if can address both of your concerns and needs much more simply."
"My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriends/lovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts. It causes me to get jealous because I'm afraid they might reconnect somehow. I've attempted to talk to her about it, but she avoids it and doesn't seem to worry about how I feel about it.","Are they friends on any other social media networks or is this just limited to Facebook. If it's just to Facebook, I would say, relax a little bit. If she still wanted to be with them, she could reach out through a private message or a number of other ways. But most likely, especially if they can talk about stuff in front of you, she is just reconnecting with some old friends.Also, would you say that you are noticing any other signs of her pushing you away or is this really the only behavior that is concerning to you.An interesting thing that happens in relationships is that when we feel close to someone, we open up emotionally and rely on the other person to meet more and more of our needs (and we are supposed to do the same for the other person). For example, it is really common for people to need their partner to be there for them when they are sad or stressed. While there are some things we can do to help for our partner in some of those cases, ultimately, if the relationship can't do anything to meet those needs, our friends can only help so much and if we don't know how to meet our own emotional needs, going to the friend is only temporarily going to help.This is a long way of saying, some of the things you are looking for may just not be the things a romantic partner can do. While it would be nice to want them to do those things and she could at any point decide to meet some of"
"My mom and I have been fighting a lot now, and I just want a good relationship with her.","Commit to sticking a pause to an argument when it can feel a little calmer. You can tell your mom(same as you can tell yourself) that even though you'd really love to fix this problem right this second, it's difficult to know how to fix this problem when both people are very upset and yelling(or however difficult it is). And then you can find a length of time you both agree will help you get calm(so you can stick to it) and once you're calm, basically you can go back to the part that you each got upset, and navigate through that part calmly.Understand that by even telling her this, you're basically taking responsibility for doing your part in this. You can direct her to this post or repeat it if she basically doesn't make an effort to be calm. But you will benefit the most out of this by staying calm yourself and committing to that part of the solution's process."
"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me,"" and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","Your roommate's drinking may not be the cause of her troubles; it is more likely a symptom of something that happened in the past that she is reactively ""self-medicating.""It is almost equally likely that no matter who she lived with, the same troubles would crop up. You harbour resentments against her and it is possible your answers to her would be ""No"" to her queries of whether you hate her. Even pitying her is passive aggressive, because deep down she knows your behaviour towards her is condescending and she is reacting accordingly.Our therapist would suggest you lovingly set boundaries arouond your own limits to how often and in what way you will ""rescue"" her."
"There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home. I have food, clothes, and a university education, but I never feel like I belong. Even when I have a good time with people who are supposed to be close, I feel like I'm just out with friends and I never go home.","What a profound and very troubling matter! Unless you are really feeling as if you had been totally alienated from the family you grew up with, I would have to think that these feelings of not belonging originate internally and come from another time in your life. That said, I just haven't enough information, do I? The answer lies in working more deeply with a therapist and being willing to journey inward in order to discover the true origin of the problem. I cannot stress enough the amazing healing that can take place in this kind of self-exploratory therapy. Find a good therapist who you feel trustworthy with and you'll discover the key. Best Wishes!"
There's this boy who asked me out awhile ago. I said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me. How do I be with him and tell him and tell my friends?,"I have been in this EXACT situation before! First off- it is hard to go against the norm of what everyone else is doing because there is comfort in numbers. Your friends and family love you, and they will likely either come around to accepting it or they may not. Often times people in our lives are unaware of how judgmental they are being. When we accept ourselves despite the judgment of others this is one of the most freeing experiences we can have. If someone in your life can't accept you for who you are they really aren't worth having in your life anyways. There will also always be other people who will support you. I love the Dr.Seuss quote “Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.” What comes through though is that whatever your decision is make sure that is YOURS. Also- think about which person do you know that you would let hold your hand, hug you, kiss you, get close to you if everyone else in the world was blind? This will help clue you in to which choice you truly want to make. , MA, NCC"
We make love once per month. Is it normal?,"That's great that you're looking at comparing your relationship to that of others around you, that's an important step toward recognizing problem areas that can ultimately lead to some sort of change that serves you both in the long term! Although there are research statistics on ""what's normal,"" the bottom line is that every couple is different. What's perhaps more important than thinking about whether you are closer to the ""norm"" (whatever that means), is considering what is best for you and your partner. Meadows, House & Van Den Berghe (2009) found that frequency of sex was not a good indicator of relationship satisfaction for both married and cohabitating couples (i.e. those who live together but are unmarried). However, for dating couples, sexual frequency was an accurate reflection of their satisfaction! So in a way, the level of satisfaction that you both feel about having sex once a month is the measure of how ""normal"" that is in your relationship.But here's a little more about the frequency of sexual activity in relationships. Wynne, West, Gaines & ,s (2007) did a pretty exhaustive review of the literature examining sexual frequency in long term relationships for couples with the following age ranges : 18-49, 31-80, 45-89. Here's what they found:-Average frequency for couples between the ages of 18-29: About 112 times per year.-Average frequency for couples between the ages of 30-49: About 86"
"When I'm sad and alone, I want to cut myself.","Being lonely is an emotion and one that many different factors contribute to. Is there a certain reason the you are alone? It may help to re-evaluate how to make the changes necessary in order to not be alone. Our emotion can also be a powerful motivator of behaviour. By telling yourself that you cannot handle it, or ""x"" has ""abandoned"" you may be triggering the desire to self harm. These are all very valid things to talk with yourself about as they may lead to some potential solutions.What I can definitely say is that someone is always willing to listen. One suggestion is to join a Meetup group in your area of something that you are interested in. They exist so that people can make new friends.If you do not wish to self harm then try to remind yourself of the reasons that you would not want to do this. What are the draws of doing this behaviour? Is it because you want someone to help you? As stated before there are people out there that may be willing. Is it because you want to punish yourself? Sometimes these beliefs are very deep rooted. In addition to my previous advice, visit some of the different resources online for self harm and share your concerns with your GP. If you are local to Peterborough, ON then DeNovo has a self help program. There is always hope and there is always help. Just reach out and keep reaching out <3"
"Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.","Public speaking is very difficult for many people. There are some things you can do on your own to address the symptoms you describe. Try this technique each day for a week (or more often if desired) which uses a grounding technique and also addresses your fears: set a timer or an alarm to repeat every 3-4 hours and when it goes off, ask yourself, ""What am I feeling right now with regard to the potential for public speaking?"" Once you have named your fear or fears, state that you are releasing that fear and that you can handle your life (which includes speaking in public).Follow that up with deep breathing. Inhale fully through your nose and then exhale completely through your mouth, gradually slowing your breath to about three deep breaths per minute, which should take about 20 seconds. When you feel balanced, ask yourself what kind of statements you need to hear with regard to what you named and journaled earlier. You want these statements to give you confidence. Here are some examples if fear public speaking: ""I can handle it if I speak in public""; ""I have a lot to say, even if I feel nervous""; as well as any other confidence-building statements with which you identify. When you have your statements, repeat them to yourself in your mind and then gradually open your eyes and stay where you are for a few seconds before rising to resume your schedule."
Why am I attracted to older men?,"Because it may be that you feel safe and protected when you are around your parents and older men. Some people are attracted to people who exhibit certain characteristics that they value. Every person will have their special qualities that matter to them. If it starts to get confusing for you seek you, to help you to sort out what you may be looking for and needing."
