"After receiving counseling, we have been told my husband has a black and white personality disorder. When I offer compromises in our disagreements, he does not seem to understand. We cannot resolve conflict because he only sees things as black or white. My husband has asked that we go to counseling this time. In the past, it has been my suggestion. We are thinking of going to a marriage mediator this time because there are financial issues that need to be resolved. He cannot see the whole picture when I attempt to explain my side to him.","It's great to hear that you and your husband have recognized the need for counseling and are considering the option of a marriage mediator. It can be challenging when one person has a black and white thinking pattern, as it can hinder effective communication and problem-solving within a relationship.

In the context of your financial issues, a marriage mediator may be helpful in facilitating a neutral and unbiased environment where both of you can express your perspectives and work towards finding compromises. Mediators are trained to help couples see and understand multiple perspectives and guide them towards finding mutually beneficial solutions.

When approaching your husband with your concerns, I suggest emphasizing the benefits of going to a marriage mediator and how it can help you both make progress in resolving conflicts. Highlight the fact that the mediator will provide a safe space for both of you to express your thoughts and concerns without judgment.

It's essential to communicate with empathy, understanding, and patience. Remember that change takes time, and your husband's black and white thinking pattern might not change overnight. Encourage him to be open-minded and willing to consider different viewpoints during the mediation process. 

Lastly, keep in mind that seeking professional help is a positive step towards improving your relationship. Sometimes, having an objective third party can provide new insights and bring about positive changes. I wish you both the best of luck on your journey towards resolving conflicts and finding common ground."
"Ever since I was little, I loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them. I treated everyone nice. For girls I liked, I would spend every second with them. It always ends the same way: “I like you as a friend,” or “I love your attention but not you.”","I can understand how frustrating and disheartening it must be to consistently experience these situations. It can be difficult when we invest our time and emotions into someone, only to find that they do not reciprocate our feelings in the same way. While rejection is undoubtedly painful, it is important to remember that it does not define your worth or your ability to find love.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that attraction and compatibility are complex and individual preferences can differ greatly. It may not be a reflection on who you are as a person, but rather a matter of personal preference. It's essential to respect the other person's feelings and choices, even if they are not what you had hoped for.

Instead of internalizing the rejections and feeling discouraged, I would encourage you to focus on self-growth and understanding. Take this opportunity to work on developing your self-confidence and self-worth independent of romantic relationships. Understand that love and relationships require mutual feelings and effort from both sides.

It can also be helpful to broaden your social circle and engage in activities where you can meet new people who share similar interests and values. Building connections and friendships can help in finding someone who appreciates you for who you are.

Remember, finding a loving and fulfilling relationship takes time, and it's important to be patient with yourself and the process. Keep an open mind and continue to be true to yourself. Ultimately, the right person who appreciates and reciprocates your feelings will come into your life when the"
"He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.","I understand how difficult it can be to navigate a situation where trust has been broken in the past. It's natural to feel unsure and skeptical, even if the person has made changes. Trust takes time to rebuild, and it's important to give yourself permission to feel cautious.

It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your doubts and concerns. Expressing your feelings and fears can promote dialogue and enable both of you to work towards rebuilding trust. It's important for him to understand how his past actions have impacted you and for you to understand his perspective as well.

While he may not have done anything recently to break your trust, it's also important to make sure that you're observing consistent behaviors over time. Trust isn't just built on one incident but on repeated actions that demonstrate reliability, honesty, and transparency.

Ultimately, the decision to stay or go is something only you can make. It's essential to prioritize your emotional well-being and consider if you can see a future where trust can be fully restored. If doubts and mistrust continue to persist, it might be beneficial to seek couples counseling or individual therapy to help explore these feelings and gain further clarity.

Remember, trust rebuilding is a gradual process, and it's crucial to be patient with yourself and your partner. Trust can be regained, but it requires openness, communication, and consistent efforts from both parties involved."

1. Allow yourself to grieve: It's important to give yourself permission to experience the grief and all the emotions that come with it. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and it's okay to feel sad, angry, or even numb. Take the time you need to mourn and honor your mom's memory.

"I am a teenager. I have been experiencing major episodes of depression (if that's even what it is) for several years. It’s always getting worse. I have been having panic attacks, feeling like I can't control my fears, and I can't even bring myself to care if I live or die anymore. The problem is that I don't know who to ask for help. When I try to talk to my parents, I freeze completely and can't do anything but make a joke because never once in my life have we talked about our feelings.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time, but I'm glad you reached out for support. It takes a lot of courage to open up about how you're feeling, especially when you haven't had much experience discussing emotions with your parents. It's important to remember that you're not alone, and there are people who can offer help and support.

One option you might consider is speaking with a trusted adult in your life, such as a teacher, school counselor, or another family member. These individuals can provide guidance and help you in finding the professional help you need. Sometimes it's easier to start a conversation about your feelings with someone who is not as close to you personally.

Additionally, many schools and communities have mental health resources available. You can reach out to your school counselor or nurse and ask about the resources they offer. They may be able to provide counseling or refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in working with teenagers.

If you ever feel like you're in immediate danger or are having thoughts of self-harm, it's crucial to reach out for help right away. In the United States, you can contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. They provide free and confidential support 24/7.

"I am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life. I had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him.
   The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. In my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting. I was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which I have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.","I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through. It can be incredibly challenging to navigate co-parenting with multiple individuals involved. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling overwhelmed by the constant drama and the impact it has on the children involved.

It sounds like you genuinely want to minimize conflicts and prioritize the well-being of the children, which is commendable. However, despite your efforts, it seems that tensions still arise. It's understandable that you feel frustrated and confused about where things went wrong.

One step you can take is to have a calm and open conversation with your ex-boyfriend (and potentially your husband as well) about establishing clear boundaries. This includes defining what responsibilities and decision-making powers each person has regarding the children. It might be helpful to involve a mediator or a professional counselor who specializes in co-parenting dynamics to facilitate these discussions.

It's also important to remember that in situations like these, emotions can run high. Try to separate yourself from the drama as much as possible and focus on what you can control, such as your own reactions and prioritizing the well-being of your daughter.

Lastly, it might be beneficial for you to seek support for yourself, either through therapy or a support group. Talking to professionals or others who have experienced similar situations can provide you with guidance, coping strategies, and a safe space to vent and process your emotions.

Remember, it's not your fault that these conflicts are occurring, and your focus should continue"
"I am going through a divorce. He is extremely angry. He refuses to physically assist me with our teenager daughter. I have no extended family support.

"I crave attention, companionship, and sex. She has had a hysterectomy, and she has a bad knee.","It sounds like you're experiencing a strong desire for attention, companionship, and intimacy, which is completely normal and understandable. However, it seems there may be some additional challenges involved, such as your partner having had a hysterectomy and a bad knee.

When it comes to feeling a lack of attention, communication with your partner is crucial.

This might include exploring different ways to create closeness, such as cuddling, sharing intimate conversation, or engaging in activities that you both enjoy. Remember, intimacy can be expressed in various ways beyond just sex.

Overall, effective communication, empathy, and understanding are key in navigating these challenges together. If the issues persist, it may be beneficial to seek the guidance of a professional counselor who can help you both explore these concerns further."
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,"I understand that feeling anger easily can be frustrating, especially when you feel like you have no control over it. It's great that you are seeking suggestions for managing your anger. Here are a few techniques that might be helpful:

1. Identify triggers: Pay attention to the situations, people, or thoughts that tend to provoke your anger. By identifying your triggers, you can be better prepared to manage your response when they occur.

2. Practice deep breathing: When you notice yourself becoming angry, take slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce the intensity of your anger response.

3. Use relaxation techniques: Engage in activities that help you relax, such as meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation. Regular practice of these techniques can help reduce overall stress levels, making it easier to manage anger.

4. Seek support: Consider talking to a counselor or therapist who can provide guidance and support in managing your anger. They can help you explore the underlying causes of your anger and develop coping strategies tailored to your specific needs.

5. Communicate assertively: Instead of reacting impulsively, try expressing your anger in a calm and assertive manner. Use ""I"" statements to express how you feel and what you need, without blaming or attacking others. This can help prevent misunderstandings and find solutions to conflicts.

"I feel like I'm ugly, stupid, useless, and that I can't make anyone happy.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I want to assure you that you are not alone. Many people experience these thoughts and feelings, and I'm here to support you through them. It's important to remember that negative self-talk can be harsh and unforgiving, often not reflecting the reality of who you truly are. 

Firstly, I want to remind you that beauty comes in many forms, and it is not solely based on external appearance. It's important to focus on your unique qualities, strengths, and the positive aspects of yourself that make you who you are. 

As for feeling stupid or useless, it's crucial to recognize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes, we tend to focus more on our shortcomings rather than appreciating our skills and accomplishments. Take some time to acknowledge the things you are good at and the achievements you've made, no matter how big or small they may seem.

Feeling like you can't make anyone happy can be tough, but it's important to remember that your worth isn't solely determined by your ability to please others. Happiness is subjective and can't be solely depended on another person. Focus on nurturing genuine connections and relationships with loved ones, but also allow yourself to prioritize your own well-being and happiness.

If these feelings persist and are impacting your daily life, it might be helpful to seek professional support. A therapist or counselor can offer guidance and strategies to improve your self-esteem and help you develop healthier thought patterns"
I have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. I really want to stop it and enjoy things.,"I understand how challenging it can be to constantly worry about what others may think of you. It's important to remember that you deserve to enjoy things and live your life free from the burden of constantly seeking validation from others.

Here are a few strategies that may help:

1. Challenge your negative thoughts: Whenever you catch yourself worrying about what others might think, challenge those thoughts. Remind yourself that it is impossible to control or please everyone, and that their opinions do not define your worth or happiness.

2. Focus on self-acceptance: Learn to accept and embrace who you are, including your imperfections. Practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes or have different opinions. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would extend to a friend.

3. Shift your perspective: Try to shift your focus from seeking external validation to internal validation. Instead of relying on others to determine your worth, learn to cultivate self-confidence and rely on your own judgment. Emphasize your strengths and accomplishments, and celebrate them.

4. Surround yourself with supportive people: Surrounding yourself with people who accept and appreciate you for who you are can be incredibly empowering. Seek out relationships and friendships with individuals who uplift and support you, and distance yourself from those who constantly criticize or undermine you.

He wants to cut it off because people are giving him a hard time that our kids will be related to my ex.,"I can understand that this situation may be causing a lot of stress for you and your current boyfriend. It's important to remember that familial relationships and societal expectations can often complicate our decisions about dating and relationships.

It might be helpful to explore some coping strategies that can help you navigate this situation. Firstly, prioritize taking care of yourself emotionally and physically. Reach out to friends, family, or a counselor like me for support during this time. It's essential to have a support system in place.

First, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your child about their current financial situation and any possible options they might have. It's important to listen to their perspective and understand the reasons behind their financial constraints. This way, you can gain a better understanding of what kind of support they might need from you, whether it's emotional or practical.

Remember, not everything is about money, and there can be alternative ways to support your child.

Additionally, helping her develop budgeting skills and finding ways to save money can be valuable in the long run.

Lastly, remind your child that going on a trip is not the only way to explore and have new experiences. Encourage her to seek out opportunities closer to home that may be more affordable or even consider looking for part-time work to save for future trips.

I have several issues like I don't like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years. When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying.

"I have three children: a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. I'm scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.","I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. It sounds like you're going through a lot of pain and guilt right now, and that can be incredibly difficult to handle. It's important to remember that you are not solely responsible for the choices your children make. Addiction is a complex issue, and there are many factors that contribute to it.

It's understandable that your daughter is angry and upset right now, but their blaming you is not fair or helpful. It may be helpful to have a conversation with her when emotions have settled, and express that you understand her pain, but also acknowledge that addiction is a personal struggle, and each individual must take responsibility for their own choices.

Given your own health challenges, it's also essential that you prioritize your own well-being. Taking care of yourself is not selfish; it's necessary in order to be there for your children. Consider reaching out to a support group or a counselor who can provide guidance and advice on how to navigate this difficult situation.

"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling alone, sad, and frustrated in your relationships. It's clear that you have a caring and compassionate nature, and it's commendable that you want to help others. However, it's important to also prioritize your own well-being and happiness in relationships. Here are a few suggestions to help you break this pattern:

1. Self-reflection: Take some time to reflect on your past relationships and analyze what attracted you to these men in difficult situations. Consider whether you have a pattern of feeling the need to rescue or fix others. Understanding your own motivations can help you make conscious choices in the future.

2. Set healthy boundaries: It's crucial to establish clear boundaries in relationships, especially when someone is struggling. Recognize that you can't singlehandedly solve someone else's problems. By setting limits and communicating your needs, you can create a healthier dynamic that allows both partners to take responsibility for their own growth.

3. Focus on compatibility: When entering a new relationship, try to prioritize compatibility in values, goals, and overall emotional health. Building a strong foundation based on shared interests, trust, and mutual support can increase the chances of a healthier and more balanced partnership.

"I met a guy a while ago, and I can't stop thinking about him. I feel like I love him, but I don't think I know him. What if he is not who I think he is? I cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend. I don't know, am I too obsessive? Every time we talk though, it's like magic. He makes me feel amazing, but what if I'm mistaken?","It's completely normal to have strong feelings for someone you've just met, especially if they make you feel amazing when you're with them. However, it's important to remember that these feelings might be based on infatuation or idealization rather than a deep understanding of who this person truly is.

It's natural to have doubts and concerns about whether someone is who you think they are. It can be challenging to differentiate between what we want to see in someone and who they truly are. Take some time to get to know him better and observe how he treats others, as it can be a good indicator of his character.

While it's okay to feel excited about someone, it's important to avoid fixating too much on a potential relationship or creating unrealistic expectations. Allow the relationship to naturally unfold and take the time to understand the person holistically.

Remember, it's also essential to take care of yourself emotionally. Allow yourself to experience and process your emotions, but try not to let them consume you. Engage in activities that bring you joy, spend time with friends and family, and focus on personal growth. This will help you maintain a healthy balance in your life.

If you continue to feel overwhelmed by your emotions or find it difficult to let go of obsessive thoughts, it might be beneficial to seek support from a professional counselor who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation."
"I met the first man five months ago. I have come a long way and do have feelings for him. I know he would do anything for me and my kids. The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him. I know they both love me, and I love both of them.","It sounds like you have a lot of love in your life, but it also seems like you might be torn between two men: the first man you met five months ago and the father of your children. It can be incredibly challenging when our hearts are divided between two people we love, and there's no easy solution or one-size-fits-all answer. It's important to take some time to reflect on what truly matters to you and what you envision for your future.

Consider asking yourself some questions: What are the qualities you value most in a partner? What kind of relationship do you want for yourself and your children in the long run? Are there any unresolved issues or challenges in your relationship with the father of your children that need to be addressed? Can those issues be resolved through open and honest communication? 

Ultimately, the decision is yours to make, but it may help to have open and honest conversations with both men involved. Express your feelings and concerns, as well as the love you have for each of them. It is important to explore their perspectives as well.

It's also worth mentioning that seeking guidance from a professional counselor or therapist could provide you with more personalized support as you navigate this challenging decision-making process. They can help you gain insight into your emotions, understand your needs, and guide you in finding the best path forward."
"I met this girl in high school. She had switched schools at the end of the year, and I have not seen her since. It's been a few years. We had a very good and friendly relationship, and we seemed to have a lot in common. I never gained the courage to ask her out.","It sounds like you had a meaningful connection with this girl in high school. It's natural to feel a sense of regret about not asking her out, especially if you had a lot in common and enjoyed each other's company. It's important to remember that missed opportunities happen to everyone at some point in their lives.

Although you may not have asked her out in high school, it's never too late to reach out and reconnect with her. Social media platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn can be great resources for finding and connecting with old friends. If you're interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her, it might be worth taking the risk and reaching out to see if she is open to reconnecting.

However, keep in mind that she may have moved on and her feelings towards you might have changed over the years. It's important not to go into this with expectations or put pressure on her to reciprocate your feelings. Approach the conversation as an opportunity to catch up and reminisce, and see where things naturally lead from there.

If you do reach out, be genuine and honest about your intentions. Let her know that you enjoyed your friendship in high school and that you've always wondered what could have happened if you had asked her out. Be prepared for any response she may give, including the possibility that she may not be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship.

Remember, it's never too late to take a chance and try to reconnect with someone from your past. Regardless of the outcome, you'll"
"I spent my whole life taking care of my dad, but left because of his verbally abusive behavior. I was the only one that helped with his health issues. I feel if I hadn't left he might still be alive. I need help dealing with my grief and guilty conscience.","I'm really sorry to hear about the loss of your dad, and I can understand how difficult it must be for you to carry this burden of guilt and grief. It's important to remember that everyone has their limits, and it sounds like you reached yours due to your dad's verbally abusive behavior. Taking care of someone with health issues can be emotionally exhausting, and it's understandable that you needed to prioritize your own well-being.

Firstly, it's important to acknowledge that you are not responsible for your dad's passing. There are many factors that contribute to a person's health, and it's not fair to blame yourself entirely. Grief can often make us feel like we could have done more, but it's essential to show yourself compassion and remind yourself that you did what you could during a difficult time.

It may be helpful for you to find a support system to help you process your emotions and guilt. Consider reaching out to a therapist or a support group where you can share your feelings in a safe and understanding environment. They can provide guidance, empathy, and help you find healthy ways to cope with your grief.

Additionally, practicing self-care is crucial during this time. Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and joy, spend time with loved ones who understand and support you, and be patient with yourself as you navigate through the healing process.

Remember, healing takes time. Allow yourself to grieve and process your"
"I was in a relationship for almost five years. We were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship. He was a caring, friendly, and charming guy up until three and a half years in. He started controlling me: who I hung out with, where I was at all times, and he had a huge hissy fit if I tried to ask him the same questions. All that time, he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my so-called friends. At the end, he was a nasty and narcissistic person. Now it’s hard to be social.","I'm really sorry to hear that you went through such a difficult experience. It can be incredibly painful when someone we care about changes and becomes controlling or abusive in a relationship. It's natural to feel hurt, betrayed, and hesitant to trust others after going through such an ordeal.

It's important to remember that the way your ex treated you says more about him than it does about you. Controlling and narcissistic behavior is not acceptable, and it's not a reflection of your worth or value as a person. Recognizing this can be the first step in healing and moving forward.

When it comes to being social again, it's understandable to feel cautious and guarded. Take your time to heal and rebuild your self-esteem. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can provide a safe space for you to open up and share your feelings. Consider seeking counseling or talking to a therapist who can help you work through the emotional aftermath of the relationship.

Remember, healing takes time, and everyone's journey is different. Be patient with yourself as you navigate through the healing process. In time, you will find the strength to trust again and form healthy social connections."
I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I’m having bad flashbacks. I’m scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.,"I'm so sorry to hear about what you've experienced. It's completely understandable that you're feeling terrified, having flashbacks, and struggling to sleep or leave your house. It takes a lot of strength to reach out and share such a traumatic experience, so please know that I'm here to support you.

It's important to remind yourself that what happened was not your fault. Rape is an act of violence and power that can happen to anyone, regardless of gender or the relationship with the perpetrator. I encourage you to consider seeking professional help, such as a counselor or therapist, who can provide specialized support during this difficult time. They can help you process the trauma, identify coping strategies, and assist you in finding ways to heal and regain control over your life.

In the meantime, there are some self-care activities you can practice to help manage your symptoms. Deep breathing exercises, grounding techniques (such as focusing on your senses or using a stress ball), and engaging in calming activities like reading or painting could potentially help you during times of distress. Creating a safe space within your home, free from reminders of the trauma, might also be helpful.

Remember, healing takes time, and everyone's journey is different. Share your feelings with trusted friends or family members who can offer support. You are not alone in this, and there are people who care and want to help you through this difficult period. Take it one day at a time and be kind to yourself – you deserve compassion and healing."
"I'm a female freshman in high school, and this question is for my male best friend. At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him.    Lately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves.    He knows that I still crush on him. He doesn't rub it in my face. He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous.","It sounds like you care a lot about your male best friend, Tim, and want to support him through his current situation. It's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding for Tim's feelings.

First, when it comes to helping Tim with his current relationship with Sally, it's important to keep in mind that he is in a committed relationship with her. While you may have your own feelings, it's best to prioritize his happiness and well-being. Encourage him to communicate openly and honestly with Sally about his concerns for the future and how he is feeling. Help him explore potential ways to strengthen their relationship, such as finding shared interests or activities they can enjoy together during the time they have left.

When Sally eventually leaves for college, it's natural for Tim to feel sad and uncertain about the future. As his friend, you can support him by being there to listen and validate his feelings. Encourage him to express his emotions and concerns without judgment or offering quick fixes. Sometimes all someone needs is a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on. Remind Tim that it's normal to feel heartbroken after a breakup, but assure him that with time and support, he will be able to heal and love again.

In terms of your own feelings for Tim, it's important to prioritize and work on your own emotional well-being before considering a future relationship. Let him know that you care about him as a friend and you want to support him genuinely without any expectations or conditions. Show him"
I'm feeling different towards my husband. I feel I am growing from the relationship. I have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five. I just don't feel that connection anymore. I feel nothing. I don't know why or if I'm just being irrational.,"It's completely normal to experience fluctuations in your feelings towards your partner over the course of a long-term relationship. It's important not to feel guilty or irrational about these changing emotions. It's worth exploring what may be causing this shift in your connection. Has anything major changed in your lives recently, such as stressful events or significant life changes? It could be helpful to communicate openly and honestly with your husband about your feelings and concerns. A heart-to-heart conversation can provide insight into each other's perspectives and potentially help in finding ways to reconnect and understand each other better. Additionally, seeking professional help from a couples therapist may be beneficial in navigating this phase and finding ways to rekindle the connection. Remember, relationships require effort and commitment from both partners to flourish."
"I'm in a lesbian relationship, and my mother doesn't really approve.","I'm here to listen and support you. It can be really difficult when our loved ones don't approve of our relationships. It's important to remember that their reaction is a reflection of their beliefs and experiences, and not a reflection of your worthiness or the validity of your relationship. That being said, finding ways to navigate this situation can be challenging. 

Have you had a conversation with your mother about her disapproval? It might be helpful to find a time when you both can talk openly and calmly about your feelings and concerns. Try to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging her perspective while also expressing your own. Remember, you can't change someone's beliefs or opinions overnight, but open dialogue may help to foster understanding and open up the possibility of acceptance over time.

If having a conversation feels too difficult or doesn't yield positive results, it's important to prioritize your wellbeing and mental health. Surrounding yourself with a supportive community can help you find validation, acceptance, and understanding outside of your family. Seek out LGBTQ+ support groups, online communities, or even counseling to connect with people who share similar experiences and can offer guidance and support.

Remember, you deserve love and happiness, regardless of other people's disapproval. Keep being true to yourself and finding ways to foster a sense of belonging and acceptance in your life."
"I'm in my early 20s. I’ve been married once, and he cheated on me. Ever since then, I've felt ugly no matter what. I'm engaged, and I still feel ugly. I don't like to take pictures of myself.","I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way. It's common for experiences like infidelity to have a lasting impact on our self-esteem and how we perceive ourselves. Remember, though, that your worth and beauty are not defined by someone else's actions or opinions.

Taking a step back, it's important to recognize that beauty is subjective and goes beyond physical appearance. True beauty lies in your unique qualities, strengths, and the way you treat others. Those are the things that make you truly special and valuable.

It might also be helpful to explore and challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs you hold about yourself. They may stem from the pain and betrayal you experienced in your previous marriage. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through these emotions and build your self-confidence.

In the meantime, try to engage in self-care activities that make you feel good about yourself. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who appreciate and value you for who you genuinely are. Remember to embrace your achievements, and focus on things you like about yourself rather than dwelling on the negatives.

Keep in mind that healing takes time, and everyone's journey is unique. It's important to be patient with yourself and give yourself the space to heal and rediscover your self-worth."
"I'm not suicidal and wouldn't take my own life, but sometimes, I've wished for an accident to occur and take it. I feel like I just shouldn't be here and wish I wouldn't have been born so I didn't have to go through life.

It takes a lot of courage to openly express these feelings, and I'm here to support you.

It's understandable that feeling unemployed, rejected, and overwhelmed can lead to feelings of depression and hopelessness. It's important to remember that everyone faces challenges in life, and sometimes it feels like we're trapped in a never-ending cycle. However, I want you to know that it's possible to find a way out of this difficult situation.

First of all, it's important to take care of your mental health. Depression can make it even more challenging to deal with the problems you're facing, so finding support and coping strategies is crucial. Have you considered seeking therapy or counseling? Speaking with a professional can help you navigate your emotions and provide you with guidance on how to move forward.

In terms of your unemployment and housing situation, it might be helpful to break things down into smaller, more manageable steps. Focus on one task at a time, such as updating your resume or searching for job opportunities in your area. Remember, setbacks happen, but it's important to persist and stay resilient.

Regarding the past mistakes that are affecting your current circumstances, it's important to acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes. It's part of being human. While it can be difficult, try not to dwell on the past and instead focus on what you can do now to improve your situation. Sometimes, seeking legal advice or assistance can help provide options for addressing past mistakes.

"I've been bulimic for about 6 years now. I'm in my early 20s. I am about to start back to school to become an RN, and I really need to get better once and for all.    I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?","I'm really sorry to hear that you've been struggling with bulimia for such a long time. It takes a lot of strength to recognize that you need help and to reach out for support. I want to commend you for taking the initiative to seek assistance.

The first step towards recovery is to reach out to a professional. I would strongly encourage you to find a therapist or counselor who specializes in eating disorders. They can provide you with the guidance and support you need on your journey to recovery. They will be able to help you understand the underlying reasons behind your behavior, develop coping mechanisms, and work towards changing your relationship with food.

Additionally, it might be beneficial to consult your primary care physician. They can assess your physical health and provide any necessary medical interventions or referrals to specialists, such as nutritionists or dietitians.

Building a support network can also be invaluable during your recovery. Consider confiding in a trusted friend or family member who can offer you emotional support and encouragement along the way. You may also want to explore support groups, both online and offline, where you can connect with others who have similar experiences.

Remember, recovery is a process, and it takes time and effort. It's important to be patient and kind to yourself as you embark on this path. Celebrate small victories and seek help whenever needed. You deserve to live a happy and healthy life, and I truly believe that with the right support and determination, you can overcome this obstacle and achieve your goals."
"I've been feeling worthless, unaccomplished, and so frustrated. I want to break things, hit myself, run away, kick, scream, and cry. I just want to be happy and outgoing again. I want to be able to take care of my daughter and live comfortably.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of negative emotions and are struggling to find happiness and fulfillment. Remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and seeking support is an important step towards finding solutions.

It can be helpful to start by understanding the root causes of your feelings. Is there something specific that's been contributing to your sense of worthlessness and frustration? Sometimes, talking to someone you trust, like a friend, family member, or counselor, can provide an opportunity for self-reflection and support.

Taking care of your mental health is crucial, especially when you have responsibilities like taking care of your daughter. Consider setting aside some time for self-care activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Engaging in activities you enjoy, exercising regularly, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and establishing a support system are all helpful ways to manage stress and promote well-being.

It's also important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and it's not fair to compare your achievements to those of others. Focus on your own progress and personal growth, and try to set realistic goals that can help you regain a sense of accomplishment. Breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable steps can make them feel less overwhelming.

If you find your negative emotions persisting and interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional. They can provide valuable guidance and support tailored to your specific situation.

"I've pretty much been on my own since day one, I'm a middle child of five, and I can't seem to put my trust in anyone. It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend. Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again. I really want some help.","I'm sorry to hear that you've had a difficult time putting your trust in others and opening up to people. It's not uncommon to struggle with building trust, especially if you've been on your own for a long time. It's great that you were able to open up to your best friend, even if it took a while. That's a positive step forward.

When it comes to developing feelings for someone and then pushing them away, it could be a defense mechanism to protect yourself from potential hurt or rejection. It's understandable that you might be afraid of getting close to someone and being vulnerable.

To start addressing this issue, it might be helpful to explore the root causes of your trust issues and fear of opening up to others. This could be done through therapy or counseling, where you can work with a professional to understand the underlying factors and develop strategies for building trust.

In the meantime, here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Take gradual steps: Instead of completely shutting people out, try taking small steps towards opening up. Share a little bit about your thoughts or feelings with someone you feel comfortable with.

2. Reflect on your fears: Take some time to reflect on what specifically makes you afraid of getting close to someone or being vulnerable. Understanding your fears better can help you develop coping strategies.

"In the state of New York, is it legal for someone to record a counseling session without telling the counselor or the other person in the session?","It's essential to emphasize that I'm not a lawyer, but I can provide you with some general information on the subject. In New York, as of my knowledge, it is a one-party consent state when it comes to recording conversations. This means that as long as one person participating in the conversation gives their consent to be recorded, it is generally legal to do so. However, it's important to consider the ethical implications of recording a counseling session without informing the counselor or obtaining their consent. Open communication and trust are vital components of a therapeutic relationship, and recording without consent may affect those dynamics. If you have concerns about recording sessions, it's best to discuss them openly and honestly with your counselor to find a resolution that respects everyone's rights and boundaries. Additionally, seeking legal advice or consulting credible sources in your area can provide more accurate and up-to-date information regarding local laws."

Friendships outside of marriage are normal and can be beneficial for our overall well-being. The key in any relationship, including friendships, is to have open communication with your spouse and maintain appropriate boundaries. As long as you are being honest, maintaining trust, and giving equal attention and care to your spouse, there should be no issue with having a best friend. It's important to remember that different relationships serve different purposes in our lives, and having diverse sources of emotional support can be enriching for everyone involved."
"Me and my adult daughter just do not get along. She's very belittling to me when I don't agree with her. It's almost like she scolds me. We get into all out war. She's said I don't support her in what she does and that I've never loved her. She calls me horrible names, and she pushes my buttons to the point I call her names.","I'm sorry to hear that you're facing such a difficult situation with your daughter. It can be incredibly hurtful to experience belittling and name-calling from someone you love. It sounds like there is a lot of tension and miscommunication between the two of you. It's important to remember that communication breakdowns are often a result of unresolved underlying issues. 

One possible approach you could consider is finding a calm moment to have an open and honest conversation with your daughter. Let her know that you value your relationship with her and that you're willing to work towards a healthier dynamic. Encourage her to express her feelings and concerns without interrupting or becoming defensive. It's crucial to actively listen to her, acknowledging her emotions and validating her point of view. 

In turn, communicate your own feelings calmly and without becoming accusatory. Express your desire to support her, but also share your need for respect and understanding in return. Avoid name-calling and try to keep the conversation focused on resolving conflicts rather than escalating them.

Additionally, it might be helpful to consider seeking professional help, such as family therapy. A therapist can facilitate a safe space for both of you to explore your relationship dynamics, understand each other's perspectives, and learn healthier ways of communicating and resolving conflicts.

Remember that healing a strained relationship takes time and effort from both parties involved. It's important to approach this process with empathy, patience, and willingness to change."
"My boyfriend and I recently broke up. One week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. He completely deleted me out of his life. He does have an opiate addiction. He claimed he was sober, but since we've split, I've heard many lies from him. Could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind?","I'm truly sorry to hear about your breakup and the challenges you're currently facing. Addiction can be a difficult and complex issue that affects both the individual experiencing it and those close to them. While I can't speak directly to your ex-boyfriend's situation, it is possible that he may be using again if you've noticed signs of him lying and exhibiting behaviors consistent with his past addiction.

Substance addiction can have a profound impact on an individual's mental and emotional well-being. Drugs like opiates can alter brain chemistry, impair judgment, and contribute to changes in behavior. Addiction can also lead to secrecy, isolation, and strained relationships.

Remember, it is not your responsibility to diagnose or manage your ex-boyfriend's addiction. However, it may be helpful for you to focus on your own well-being during this time. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, and consider seeking your own professional help, such as counseling, to help you process your feelings and navigate this difficult situation.

If you're concerned about your ex-boyfriend's well-being, you might encourage him to seek professional help or share your concerns with someone close to him who could offer support.

"My girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriends/lovers on Facebook who actively like and comment on posts. It causes me to get jealous because I'm afraid they might reconnect somehow.

It's normal to have some degree of discomfort when our current partners maintain close relationships with their exes. However, it's important to approach this issue with open communication and empathy.

When talking to your girlfriend about your concerns, try to create a safe space for an open conversation. Express your feelings calmly and honestly, making sure she understands that you're not trying to control her or dictate her friendships.

It's also essential to be open to her perspective. Ask her to share her thoughts and feelings regarding her friendships with her exes. Listen to her without judgment and try to understand why she values these connections. It's possible that she sees them purely as friends without any romantic intentions.

Ultimately, it comes down to establishing some healthy boundaries that both of you are comfortable with. Discuss what actions or behaviors would make you feel more at ease, such as limiting public displays of affection on social media or having more open conversations about their interactions. Remember that compromise is key in any relationship.

If your girlfriend continues to avoid the conversation and disregards your feelings, it might be worth exploring deeper communication issues within the relationship. A relationship should be built on mutual respect and understanding. If these core elements are lacking, it's important to address them together or seek couples counseling for further assistance.

"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me,"" and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","It sounds like you are in a difficult situation with your roommate, and I appreciate you reaching out for support. Dealing with someone who has a drinking problem can be challenging, especially when their behavior impacts your daily life. It's important to remember that you are not responsible for your roommate's actions or emotions, but it's understandable that you might want to help. 

Firstly, it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being. Living in a situation where you constantly feel pressured to validate your roommate's emotions can be emotionally exhausting for you. It's okay to set boundaries and let her know when her behavior is affecting you negatively. 

Encourage your roommate to seek professional help for her drinking problem and her mental health concerns. Professional counselors or therapists have the skills and experience to provide the necessary support. Help her understand that reaching out for help is a courageous step towards improving her overall well-being. 

Additionally, you can suggest support groups or resources specifically targeted towards individuals dealing with addiction and mental health issues. These communities can offer her a space to connect with people who are going through similar experiences and provide additional guidance and understanding.

Lastly, remember that you cannot fix your roommate's problems on your own. You can be there to lend emotional support, but she ultimately needs to take responsibility for her actions and seek the help she needs. Encourage her to rely on a support network, and suggest that she build connections with friends, family, or professionals who can provide assistance during this challenging time.

Remember"
"There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home. I have food, clothes, and a university education, but I never feel like I belong. Even when I have a good time with people who are supposed to be close, I feel like I'm just out with friends and I never go home.","It's understandable that despite having a loving support system and all the basic necessities, you still feel a sense of not belonging. Feeling disconnected despite being surrounded by people can be quite distressing. It's important to remember that it's okay to experience these emotions, and you're not alone in feeling this way.

One possible reason for feeling this sense of detachment could be a lack of deeper emotional connection with those around you. While it's great to have friends and a support system, it's also important to develop intimate connections with individuals who truly understand and relate to you on a deeper level. Building these connections often takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself.

Additionally, it might be helpful to explore your own perspective and expectations regarding what belonging means to you. Sometimes, our own internal beliefs or past experiences can shape our sense of belonging. Reflecting on these experiences and examining any underlying issues can often offer valuable insights.

Engaging in activities or practices that promote self-awareness and self-acceptance might also help you develop a stronger sense of belonging. Exploring activities that bring you joy, pursuing hobbies, or joining interest-based communities can enable you to meet like-minded individuals who share similar interests and values.

Remember, nurturing a sense of belonging is a personal and ongoing journey. It's important to be gentle with yourself and seek support from others if needed. If these feelings persist and cause significant distress, consider seeking professional help from a counselor who can guide you through this process."
There's this boy who asked me out awhile ago. I said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me. How do I be with him and tell him and tell my friends?,"It's completely understandable that you may have concerns about what your friends and family may think about your dating choices. It's important to remember that ultimately, the decision of who you choose to be with is yours, and it should be based on your own feelings and happiness rather than solely on the opinions of others.

If you're interested in pursuing a relationship with this boy, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns. Express your feelings and fears, and see if the two of you can find ways to navigate through any potential challenges together.

When it comes to sharing the news with your friends and family, it can be helpful to ease into the conversation gradually. Start by sharing positive aspects about this person and emphasize the qualities that drew you to them. It might also be helpful to communicate your own desire for happiness and fulfillment, and explain that you believe this relationship has the potential to provide that for you.

Remember, some people might need time to adjust to the idea, and that's okay. Give them the opportunity to understand and accept your choice at their own pace. Ultimately, what matters most is that you follow your heart and make choices that bring you joy and fulfillment in your life."
We make love once per month. Is it normal?,"Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concern. It's important to remember that what is considered ""normal"" can vary from person to person and couple to couple. Sexual frequency can be influenced by a variety of factors such as individual preferences, physical and emotional well-being, and relationship dynamics.

However, it can be helpful to assess whether both you and your partner are satisfied with your current level of intimacy. Open and honest communication is key in any relationship. Have a calm and non-judgmental conversation with your partner about your needs, desires, and expectations regarding physical intimacy.

By having this discussion, you can better understand each other's perspectives and find a compromise that aligns with both of your needs. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy and respect, as everyone's desires and libido can vary.

If you find it challenging to discuss or if the discrepancy in sexual frequency is causing distress or strain in your relationship, it may be worth considering seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in couples' therapy. They can provide guidance and support in navigating this issue.

Remember, relationships are unique, and what matters most is both partners feeling satisfied, respected, and loved."
"When I'm sad and alone, I want to cut myself.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I can't provide the help that you need. It's important to reach out to someone you trust for support, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life."
"Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.","It sounds like you may be experiencing social anxiety, which is a very common reaction to public speaking or being in large crowds. I understand how distressing and overwhelming it can feel. Remember, you're not alone in this and there are ways to manage and overcome these feelings.

One technique you can try is deep breathing exercises. When you start feeling anxious, take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can help regulate your breathing and calm your nervous system.

Another helpful strategy is gradually exposing yourself to situations that make you anxious. Start by practicing speaking in front of smaller groups or trusted friends and gradually work your way up. Taking small steps can help build your confidence and reduce anxiety over time.

It may also be beneficial to challenge any negative thoughts or beliefs you have about public speaking or being in crowds. Recognize that everyone experiences nerves to some extent, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Remind yourself of your strengths and positive qualities, and focus on the message or purpose behind your speaking engagement.

If these suggestions don't alleviate your symptoms or if your anxiety becomes significantly debilitating, it may be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional. They can provide additional resources and guidance tailored to your specific needs.

Remember, it's important to be kind and patient with yourself during this process. Overcoming anxiety takes time and practice. You're capable of managing this, and I believe in your ability to grow stronger and more confident in these situations."
